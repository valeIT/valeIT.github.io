This policy explains which kind of information our websites and apps collect. This policy applies to both [valentinourbano.com](http://www.valentinourbano.com) and all of our Apps. The term "our websites and apps" refers to any of them.

**We value privacy, those are few of our key principles:**

- **We never ask you for personal information of any kind, unless truly needed (ie. asking for credit card information when you purchase anything, your email address for customer support,...etc.);**
- **We don’t store personal information on our servers unless required for the on-going operation of one of our services;**
- **We're not in the business of selling your data, and never will. We are in the business of selling our apps and providing outstanding customer support;**
- **We don’t share your personal information with anyone except to comply with the law, develop our products, or protect our rights.**

#### Website Visitors and App Users

Like most website operators, our websites and apps collect non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. The purpose in collecting non-personally-identifying information is to better understand how visitors use our websites and apps. From time to time,We may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of our websites or apps.

I don't store any analytics on our servers. They are operated by [Google Analytics](http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/) for the websites, [Crashlytics](https://get.fabric.io/crashlytics) for iOs apps and [DevMate](http://devmate.com/policy) for Mac apps.
