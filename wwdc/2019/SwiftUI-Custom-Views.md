# SwiftUI Custom Views

{% include_relative BeforeEachFile.md %}

SwiftUI views are composable. You can pull out a view into a different struct so all of your code is neatly organized.

List acts as a tableview, ForEach instead only loops and you can return whatever custom view you want yourself.

20 lines to have a lot of functionalities. Would have taken hundreds of lines with UIKit/AppKit.
