This is the second time I've installed the first beta on my Mac. I usually wait until beta 5 at least since it is usually way too  unstable. The other time I did that was when they unveiled Swift.

SwiftUI and Combine are the future of iOS development. I've used a similar paradigm with [Flutter][1] for a while and it is a great way to both build UI interfaces and reason about data.

The key takeaway is: UI as a function of state. The UI is immutable and it gets redrawn based on the state. There is a single source of truth for the data.
