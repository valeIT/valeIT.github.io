Feel free to open an [issue](https://github.com/valeIT/valeIT.github.io/issues) or submit a [pull request](https://github.com/valeIT/valeIT.github.io/pulls) if you spot any mistake. Also feel free to credit yourself for that if you want to at the bottom of the article you corrected. For pages, if anyone wants I'll open a page just for that.
