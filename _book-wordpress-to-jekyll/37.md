#### Extra: What if it shutdowns and need to migrate

I could still fix it myself if that was the only option, but I wouldn't have the time to maintain such a framework by myself. Jekyll being the most used one of the bunch is the least likely to get shut down or having people losing interest and stop developing for it. Of course, I might be wrong and Jekyll may be the first one to shut down, you never know. If that's the case, with all the content being in plain markdown the migration is going to be less traumatic than the initial one from WordPress.

I can just switch to any other framework that generates a static website since they all accept markdown files as input for your articles[^6]. All of this could be done by implementing a few "minor" changes (mainly to the YAML on top of every post and some configuration files). The migration could even be automated with a script: Scan each file for the font matter and replace what's different with the proper YAML format.


[^6]: If I had to change my second choice would be Gatsby JS.
