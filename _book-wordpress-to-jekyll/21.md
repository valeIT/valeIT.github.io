## Migrating

After much theory, we reached the exciting part of the journey. Migration all of your posts automatically from your old WordPress blog to Jekyll.

My previous blog was on WordPress and I needed to migrate all of my posts. The current instructions to migrate a `wordpress.org` blog (so the self-hosted one) are bugged so here I'll be using the ones for a `wordpress.com` installation which also supports the self-hosted version.

Go to your WordPress dashboard `http://www.valentinourbano.com/wp-admin/`. Go to `Tools` -> `Export` -> `Export All`. Doing that will download a .xml file to your computer containing all your articles. To automatically import it we can use the Jekyll Importer tool.

Open Terminal and install the Importer `gem install jekyll-import`. After installing it run:

```
ruby -rubygems -e 'require "jekyll-import";
    JekyllImport::Importers::WordpressDotCom.run({
      "source" => "FILENAME.xml",
      "no_fetch_images" => false,
      "assets_folder" => "assets"
    })'
```

If it complains about missing dependencies run `gem install DEPENDENCY_NAME` for all the missing dependencies and try again. Once finished you should have a few folders, including a `_posts` folder with as many `.html` files as you had articles. A `_pages` folder with all your pages. And in the end and `_assets` folder with all your images.

You can copy those to your Jekyll site and overwrite the default skeleton folders in there and your site should work as it did before with all the posts.
