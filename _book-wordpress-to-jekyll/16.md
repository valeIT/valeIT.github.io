title: Setting up your machine for SSH access to Github
---

[**If you've already set up your machine for SSH access, or you're used in doing it, freely skip to the next section**](#testing-the-website)

First, you will need to make sure that `openssl` is installed. If not you can install it using [homebrew](https://brew.sh/): `brew install openssl`.

#### Generate a key

[If you are on windows you can read my guide on how to set up an SSH key on Windows][3].

Open up your terminal and [generate the key][4] by running (taking care of adding your email instead of the example one):

`ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "email@email.com"`

You can leave the default filename or choose a custom one if you don't have a need for a custom name you should leave the default one.

Choose a strong password to protect your key and save it in your password manager.

#### Add the key to the SSH agent

- Start the ssh-agent if it's not already running by typing `eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"` in your Terminal
- Edit `~/.ssh/config` (for example by running `nano ~/.ssh/config`) and set up the SSH agent to automatically load keys on startup on top of allowing it to save passwords to the keychain so you don't have to type it every time:

```
Host *
  AddKeysToAgent yes
  UseKeychain yes
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa
```

- Finally, add the key to the agent by running `ssh-add -K ~/.ssh/id_rsa`

#### Add the key to Github

Now that you have generated a key and added it to the agent you can Log In to Github and add the key to your account.

- Log In to your Github Account
- Go to "Settings" > "SSH and GPG keys"
- Open your terminal and print your public key by running `cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`, copy the output
- Go back to Github and click on "New SSH key"
- Paste your PUBLIC key (you can also give it a title to remember the name of the device)

#### Testing out the connection

- Go back to your Terminal and run `ssh -T git@github.com`. Type yes when it prompts you to continue (if you want to check that you're really connecting to Github you can check the RSA fingerprint displayed in your terminal to the ones [provided by Github][5]).
- If you see "You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access." you've set up everything correctly, otherwise [check out Github's troubleshooting steps][6]

We're are not going to set up or push to a repository yet. We've set up the key not so that we don't have to go through the lengthy process of setting up a key once everything is ready. Next up is actually setting up the website with Jekyll.
