title: Setting up your GitHub pages repository

Now that we have installed Jekyll locally we need to start thinking about where to host our website. There are many alternative services that offer free or paid static website hosting. We are going to focus on the free ones. The two major ones being Github and Gitlab.

In this book we will cover GitHub since it's the most popular and used of the two. The process for Gitlab is a bit more convoluted, but it is [relatively similar][1].

The first step is to create a new Github account or login into an existing one.

Once that's done you can go ahead and [create a new public repository](https://github.com/new) to host the files and content of the website. You can choose if you want it to be accessible by everyone (public) or only by you (private). Private repositories are way more limited in the kind of automatic actions and bots they support. More advanced part of this book will only be available for public repositories.

[Unless you plan on forking a theme], choose a name, ignoring the `Need inspiration? How about verbose-octo-waffle.` proposed by Github. I'm sure you can come up with a better name than that...

Before doing anything else you need to think about which URL you want to use:
Decide if your website is going to be at `http://USERNAME.github.io/` of at `http://USERNAME.github.io/REPOSITORY_NAME`. For now, I plan to have my website at `http://valeIT.github.io/` of course if you plan to redirect to it from your main website URL it is not really relevant. In my case, http://www.valentinourbano.com will bring you there so it's not really important where it is located.

Usually, the `http://USERNAME.github.io/REPONAME` is used for singular projects while the `http://USERNAME.github.io/` is used for personal sites not related to a specific project.

Create a new repository there, or just fork whatever them you plan on using ([I'm using the 'Mediator' theme at the moment](https://github.com/dirkfabisch/mediator), but [kasper](https://github.com/rosario/kasper) and [HMFAYSAL OMEGA](https://github.com/hmfaysal/hmfaysal-omega-theme) look great as well).

_Please note that this Article is mainly based on forking the mediator theme so that's the easiest way to follow the guide if you're new to Jekyll._

If you forked a theme you can skip the next chapter and [go to Forked Mediator](#forked-a-theme) to set up your theme. Otherwise, we are going to continue setting up a new repository.
