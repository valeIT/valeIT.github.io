title: Setting up your GitHub pages repository
---

Login into Github and [create a new public repository](https://github.com/new) [Unless you plan on forking a theme], choose a name, ignoring the `Need inspiration? How about verbose-octo-waffle.` proposed by Github. I'm sure you can come up with a better name yourself.

Before doing anything else you need to think about which URL you want to use:
Decide if your website is going to be at `http://USERNAME.github.io/` of at `http://USERNAME.github.io/REPOSITORY_NAME`. For now, I plan to have my website at `http://valeIT.github.io/` of course if you plan to redirect to it from your main website URL it is not really relevant. In my case, http://www.valentinourbano.com will bring you there so it's not really important where it is located.

Usually, the `http://USERNAME.github.io/REPONAME` is used for singular projects while the `http://USERNAME.github.io/` is used for personal sites not related to a specific project.

Create a new repository there, or just fork whatever them you plan on using ([I'm using the 'Mediator' theme at the moment](https://github.com/dirkfabisch/mediator), but [kasper](https://github.com/rosario/kasper) and [HMFAYSAL OMEGA](https://github.com/hmfaysal/hmfaysal-omega-theme) look great as well).

_Please note that this Article is mainly based on forking the mediator theme so that's the easiest way to follow the guide if you're new to Jekyll._

If you forked a theme you can skip the next chapter and [go to Forked Mediator](#forked-a-theme) to set up your theme. Otherwise, we are going to continue setting up a new repository.
