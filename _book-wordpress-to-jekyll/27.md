title: Including non-Jekyll content
order_number: 27
---

On top of the pages generated by Jekyll, I have parts of my website that are plain HTML,CSS and JS files.

Jekyll supports them out of the box and will automatically include them in the generated website. Some real examples from my website are the pages for [Minimal Counter](http://www.valentinourbano.com/apps/ios/minimalcounter/), [SWTOR Calculator](http://www.valentinourbano.com/apps/ios/swtorcalculator/) and [IPLocation](http://www.valentinourbano.com/apps/mac/iplocation/).

Any of your HTML, CSS and javascript pages that you include in your website will be included verbatim. You can make folders to setup URLs as you do normally with you markdown content. The folders will set the namespace and eventual .md files that you add will be converted to html files so you could even create an hybrid approach between the two if you wanted (not that it is reccomended).
