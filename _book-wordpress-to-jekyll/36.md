##### Extra: Configuring CNAME

Create a new `CNAME` DNS record from your registrar and decide if the canonical url for your website should be with or without www, without it looks more clean, with is better for tecnical reasons. Github strongly advises to use a www subdomain for the following reasons:

> It gives your GitHub Pages site the benefit of our Content Delivery Network.
> It will not be affected by changes in the underlying IP addresses of GitHub's servers.
> Pages will load significantly faster because Denial of Service protection can be implemented more efficiently.

A guide from Github on how to set it up:

> If your CNAME file contains example.com, then www.example.com will redirect to example.com.
> If your CNAME file contains www.example.com, then example.com will redirect to www.example.com.
> You may be able to use a custom subdomain other than www together with a custom apex domain via domain redirection (sometimes called "domain forwarding"). Note, however, that this will only work for User and Organization Pagesâ€”not for Project Pages.

You will need to add a `CNAME` record with either `example.com` or `www.example.com`, that's what's going to be used. Setting it up helps you with Google rankings as well since the crawl bots won't see the www and non www page as duplicate content and donwrank you for it.

DNS changes will take up to 24 hours to propagate.
