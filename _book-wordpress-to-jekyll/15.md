## Jekyll File Structure

The structure of your new website is not super complicated. Everything that starts with an underscore "\_" is your source that will generate the website. Once generated the site will live in the "\_site" folder.

- \_config.yml

This file stores the configuration of your website like the URL, the name, setup defaults and so on.

- \_data

This folder includes files used to get data that will be accessible from anywhere else on the site. For example you could have a .yaml file with a list of your projects for a portfolio or a list of links.

- \_drafts

The folder to store the drafts of your articles that will not be published on the web until the get moved to the \_posts folder.

- \_includes

Files here can be included from anywhere else on the website so you usually put here your headers and footers, but also utilities.

- \_layouts

Here are stored templates for your pages. You could have one template for your blog posts and another template for your pages.

- \_posts

It includes all your published blog posts. Keep in mind that the filename should follow this convention: YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.extension

- \_sass

It includes all of your CSS that will be compacted into one output file during the build.

- \_site

Once built your site will be generated inside this folder.

- other folders

Any other folder will be copied to your website, so you could have a folder called "folder1" that point to mysite.com/folder1 and so on.
