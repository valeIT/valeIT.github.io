title: Converting the HTML files to Markdown
order_number: 22

NOTE: Make a backup of your HTML files before trying this!

Having all the files in HTML though is not pretty so I tried to find a way to convert them all to markdown. Most of the solutions I found did a terrible job at it and completely broke the formatting in most of the articles. The only decent one I found is in javascript so you will need to have `npm` installed.

#### Install NPM

[Download `node.js`](https://nodejs.org/en/) for your OS, after installing it update it to the latest version of `npm` by running `sudo npm install npm -g`.

#### Install HTMLMD

The tool I found is called `htmlmd` , install it running `npm -g install html-md`. I also wrote a very basic script to automatically convert all of the content of a folder from HTML to markdown.

- Open Terminal and navigate to the desktop (this is assuming your `_posts` folder is on the desktop)
- Copy this script to your desktop and call the file`scanFolder.sh`

```
for entry in *

do

htmlmd "$entry" > "$entry.md"

done
```

- In terminal navigate to the `_posts` folder: `cd _posts`
- Run the script: `bash "../scanFolder.sh"` or wherever you saved the script
- Wait until the script finished (it will take a long time if you have more than a hundred posts)
- Delete all the .html files (just sort them for extension)
- Copy the folder back to your Jekyll installation and run the server
- Check if everything's ok. If it's not, restore the HTML from the backup [And let me know if you find a better converter]
