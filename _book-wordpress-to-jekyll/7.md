title: The Various Options For Static Websites
---

Since I've been interested in doing this for years, I've read about and tried locally many markdown static website generators.

This is a comprehensive list of everything I've tried:

- [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) - The standard that started the whole movement of static markdown websites.
- [Octopress](http://octopress.org) - Opinionated customization of Jekyll built for blogging.
- [Second Crack](https://github.com/marcoarment/secondcrack) - A hobby project of a developer I follow. It works well, but it should not be used for production use since it doesn't really have a community behind it.
- [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) - Really fast, but lacks plugins and extensibility.
- [Ghost](https://ghost.org/) - Great look out of the box, needs a VPS.
- [Brunch](http://brunch.io/)
- [Hexo](https://hexo.io/)
- [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org) - Based on React. Great if you're already using React on other project or if you'd like to learn it.
- [Gitbook](https://www.gitbook.com) - Super simple to set up and use, but limited in extensibility and customization. Great for documentation, books, and tutorials.

I'm sure I missed many of them, but I feel like these ones are the most used and/or famous. Of all of these, I particularly liked Gatsby, Jekyll, and Ghost.

A few of these solutions (Ghost and Second Crack for example) need either a VPS to build the website or a manual deployment process where you built the website yourself and deploy the generated website to your server.

Nowadays you can use [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com) to automatically run a "cloud function" after each deploy to generate your website and deploy it so it's less of a hassle, but it still not straightforward to set up. I've tried Netlify with both Jekyll and Gatsby and it works well.
