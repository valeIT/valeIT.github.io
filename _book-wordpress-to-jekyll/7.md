title: The Various Options For Static Websites
order_number: 7

The last few years have seen an explosion in static website generators. The end result is similar, but they all are unique and different in how they get there.

This is a comprehensive list of everything I've tried, ordered by most recommended to least:

- [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) - The standard that started the whole movement of static markdown websites.
- [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org) - Based on React. Great if you're already using React on other project or if you'd like to learn it.
- [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) - Really fast, but lacks plugins and extensibility.
- [Ghost](https://ghost.org/) - Great look out of the box, needs a VPS.
- [Octopress](http://octopress.org) - Opinionated customization of Jekyll built for blogging.
- [Brunch](http://brunch.io/)
- [Hexo](https://hexo.io/)
- [Gitbook](https://www.gitbook.com) - Super simple to set up and use, but limited in extensibility and customization. Great for documentation, books, and tutorials.
- [Second Crack](https://github.com/marcoarment/secondcrack) - A hobby project of a developer I follow. It works well, but it should not be used for production use since it doesn't really have a community behind it.

I'm sure I missed many of them, but I feel like these ones are the most popular or famous.

A few of these solutions (Ghost and Second Crack for example) need either a VPS (Virtual Private Server) to build the website or a manual deployment process where you build the website yourself and deploy the generated website to your server.

This is less than ideal.

The former has some merits, you control the whole stack so you can customize the server for your needs. On top of that you could reuse the machine for other tasks if you need to, since a static website it is not a big burden on a server so a lot of its resources would be free to do something else unless you really have a LOT of traffic.

The latter is a real problem. The process of publishing something new should be as straight-forward as possible so that there is little friction between writing and pressing publish. Since it is already going to be complicated for someone with little technical background, adding more steps to the process is going to turn a lot of people off, when on WordPress you simply open the new post page and write.

The keys for choosing are:

1. Reliability and Stability
It needs to be a mature solution that is used in production environments by many people in the industry. It needs to simply work and does not require any custom hacks to get the result you want.
1. Active Community
It needs to be actively developed and have a lot of people using it. It needs to have plugins for the most common use cases that are not covered out of the box.
1. Ease of Use And Customization
It needs to be easy to customize by the end user without having to learn how the internals of it work.
1. Future Prood
It needs to be easy to migrate off to in the unlikely event that it is needed. This is true for all of the choices since all the articles are simple markdown files.

In the next chapter we will see why Jekyll is still the safe choice in 2020 and what are the best alternatives if you want to be on the cutting edge (and ignore point one).
