## Install Jekyll

Open terminal again and run:
`gem install jekyll`

Additionally, install `bundler`, we'll need it later:
`gem install bundler`

During the installation it might happen that nokogiri fails to install. If it fails, try installing it without the native extensions. Before trying to install jekyll again run:
`gem install nokogiri -- --use-system-libraries --with-xml2-include=/usr/include/libxml2 --with-xml2-lib=/usr/lib`
If it fails again try following [this thread][2] for troubleshooting steps.
