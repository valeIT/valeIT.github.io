title: More About Your Site Structure
---

We've already done [a basic introduction](#site-structure) on the site structure and what each folder contains. Now we will go more in detail for each section;

- **`_config.yml`** : The main configuration file for your site. [Covered here](#Initial-configuration).
- **`Gemfile`** : Includes all your plugins. [Covered here](#Plugins).
- **`_include`** : The html files for your header and footer, here you can add additional files to be included in any of your layouts. For example, I added a file for my navigation menu so I don't have to copy it to every page each time.
- **`_layouts`** : The different layouts, the default ones are for pages, articles and a general one. You can freely add more or modify the existing ones.
- **`_posts`** : Here is where all your articles reside. Every post in this folder will be published, create a `_drafts` folder to store unpublished drafts. Each post to be parsed needs to start with:

```
---
layout: post
title: Title of the Article
date: 2019-05-16 18:19:03.000000000 +01:00

Content of the Post
```

(Note the `——-` at the top and after the info)

- **`assets`** : All the images and downloadable content for your website needs to be put here, it'll be accessible directly from `assets/fileName`
- **`css`** : All the CSS will go here
- **`_sass`** : All the sass will go here (just leave it be if you don't know what it is and don't want to use it for now). It will automatically be compiled down to CSS by Jekyll.
- **Other Folders** : You can add pages, for example `/about` by simply adding folders and putting `index.md / index.markdown / index.html` files in it. Note that the file needs to be named "index". Every page to be parsed needs to start with:

```
---
layout: page
title: Title of the page
---
```

- **`index.html`** : The homepage of your website
- **`_site`** : This folder is generated automatically, you can look at it, but don't modify anything (If you do it'll just get overwritten the next time you build)
- **`CNAME`** : If you're using a custom domain name you will need to include it here. The content of mine is: `www.valentinourbano.com`
