## Requirements

To be able to follow along you need to be familiar with the command line and have basic html and css knowledge. While the latter can be optional (but strongly recommended) the former is necessary since most of your daily tasks such as updating the website require the command line.

You can still follow this book if you have really basic command line experience, but is it going to be harder and it is going to require some more dedication on your part, but it is achivable.

## Structure

The book is divided in 3 macro areas Beginner, Intermediate and Advanced.

The beginner section covers everything from creating a new Github repository to migrating the website from WordPress to Jekyll. By the end of this section you will have a working site with a custom theme and your articles. 

The next two sections are optionals and go more in depth into features of Jekyll (but not only Jekyll) that you might not know were there and how to get the most of them. Intermediate will mostly focus on Jekyll itself while Advanced will cover the broader ecosystem around it.
