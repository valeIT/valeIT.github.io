Collections are for all the content that is not timed based. The difference between this and pages is that by using a collection the pages will be automatically generated by Jekyll. What you need to do is define the data and add the entry in the configuration file. Truth be told a collection is what is under the hood powering this book on the web. Each chapter is a markdown file and Jekyll is putting it all together behind the scenes.
