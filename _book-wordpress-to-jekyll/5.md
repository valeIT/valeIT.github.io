This book includes a deep dive on what you need to do if you want to embark in the same journey I overtook by migrating my website from WordPress to Jekyll.

It requires some technical knowledge, but it is not unachievable. You need to be familiar with the command line and know the basics of HTML, CSS, and JS. It would also be nice, but not necessary to know something about GIT. If you are not a technical person and you're looking for a super easy solution to just publish content online this is not for you. You can keep using WordPress or something like [Squarespace][12], a static website generator requires a minimum of technical knowledge.

I had been thinking about doing it for almost 5 years before actually going through with it. I had always been scared of totally breaking the website by migrating it off something well established as WordPress and that I'd been using for years at that point to something less "mainstream". My process looked something like this: I would write each post in markdown in Byword (both on iOS and Mac OSX), convert it to HTML and paste it manually into the WordPress textbox. Doing all of this each time felt a bit too much friction. It wasn't broke, but it surely could have been improved.

Early on I decided that I would want to go for a static site. The content of the site would not change much and it surely wasn't dynamic. I could easily rebuild all the static pages when I published an article.
