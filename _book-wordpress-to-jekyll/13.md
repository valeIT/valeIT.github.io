### New Repository

If you have a new repository running `jekyll new` will automatically generate a base template for you to get started[^3]. Note that this will create a basic site (best suited for blogs), if you have different needs you should use a [theme](#forked-a-theme) For now leave everything as it is and [skip](#testing-the-website) the next section.

- Open Terminal.app app and run `jekyll new`.
- Open your browser of choice to http://localhost:8000

[^3]: If you're confused on what to do [follow the points in Forked a theme instead](#forked-a-theme).
