title: New Repository
---

In the previous chapter we have created a new empty repository on Github and synced it to our machine. We can now open the Terminal, navigate to it and run `jekyll new`. This will automatically generate a base website using the default Jekyll template for you to get started quickly[^3].

Note that this will create a basic site which is best suited for blogs. If you have different needs you should use a [custom theme](#forked-a-theme). For now leave everything as it is, skip the next section which talks about how to use a custom theme instead, and go directly to checking it out.

- Open Terminal.app app and run `jekyll serve`.
- Open your browser of choice to http://localhost:8000 and take a look at the website.

We will go more in-depth into it in the chapter [test your website](#testing-the-website).

[^3]: If you're confused on what to do [follow the points in Forked a theme instead](#forked-a-theme).
