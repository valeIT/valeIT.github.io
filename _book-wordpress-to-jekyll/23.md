It's always a nice practice to include a `README.md` and a `LICENSE` file if you're going to make your site open source.

In the README you could just include a link to this guide, or write something specific to your website I've simply included a link to the website. For the LICENSE I licensed the code as MIT and the articles as Creative Commons (read the actual LICENSE file for the updated and valid licenses). [You can find out more about it here](http://choosealicense.com)
