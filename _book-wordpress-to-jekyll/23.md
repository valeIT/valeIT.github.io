Now that we have the basics down and the website is working and is populated with your article we can touch on less core topics. If you only cared about getting the website running and choosing a theme this is your chance to get off the bus. Otherwise we are going to explore a bit more.

From this moment on, we are going to dive more in-depth into a few solutions I've adopted specifically for my website to solve some problems the stock version didn't solve or was not particularly clear on how to implement. Since it's live on [Github][1] you can check it all out any time.
