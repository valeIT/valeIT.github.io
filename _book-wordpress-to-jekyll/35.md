### URL


Set up custom URL.


#### Domain

*This will cover point your dns to Github servers, if you use a different provider you will need to change the IP addresses*

First, you will need to [configure your DNS](https://help.github.com/articles/tips-for-configuring-an-a-record-with-your-dns-provider/) from your registrar to point to Github or whever your website is located.

Create two `A` records that point to these 2 IPs (in case you're using Github Pages):

`192.30.252.153`
`192.30.252.154`

If your provider supports `ANAME` or `ALIAS` records you can set those instead to point to `USERNAME.github.io`. Double check its value, it should be USERNAME.github.io and NOT just github.io.

Now upload a file named `CNAME` to the root of your GitHub page to configure your website to be accessible from your domain. Its content should be the URL (without `https` or `http`) of your website (root). Ex: `www.valentinourbano.com`

Mind that DNS changes are cached so it will take some time for them to propagate (up to 24 hours). You can speed up the process by cleaning up your DNS settings.
