If you want a Jekyll blog that's all you need. You could have a very basic one for way less, but the guide above covers most use cases. You still need to be a programmer or at least comfortable around the command line to build it and update it so it is not for everyone, but having the possibility of running it without a server with very minimal overhead and cost is a killer.

Just having the website up on Github Pages is a great first step, but it doesn't need to step there if you want to go further. This appendix cover a few more cases that might be useful. At the end we're going to have a fully static website that supports custom domains, https and a content delivery network (cdn).
