## Install RVM and Ruby

Before trying to install any dev tools on a Mac it is a good idea to install the Xcode command line helper from Apple. Open Terminal.app and run `sudo xcode-select --install`. It will ask for your Mac's password and install the developer tools.

The version of Ruby that comes installed with OSX is really outdated and it shouldn't be used â€” ever.
Open Terminal.app again and install RVM (a version manager for Ruby that lets you install and switch between different versions of Ruby with ease), and the latest version of Ruby:
`\curl -sSL https://get.rvm.io | bash -s stable --ruby`

After that is good practice to update your gems (the ruby 'libraries' you have installed), run:
`gem update`

After all of that is done it is time to install Jekyll itself.
