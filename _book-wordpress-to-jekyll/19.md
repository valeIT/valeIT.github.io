## Plugins

**Note**: According to an answer to my StackOverflow question and answers from Github directly plugins are not officially supported by Github Pages. Use them at your own risk.
**Update**: According to Github **some** plugins are [now officially supported](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/issues/325)

While building the site I noticed that a few important features were missing to the theme. I always wanted to have an estimated time of how long it takes to read an article and how many words it is.

Doing so I also [opened a pull request](https://github.com/gjtorikian/jekyll-time-to-read/pull/1) to have the first letter made uppercase, cause it looks way better.

Plugins installed on top of the ones already included with the theme:
- jekyll-time-to-read
- jekyll-sitemap

To install them add them both to `_config.yml` and to the `Gemfile` (Example: `gem "jekyll-time-to-read"`). Open the Terminal and run `bundle install`.

To properly configure the `jekyll-time-to-read` plugin I added it after the author field at the top of each article. I only want it for articles so I added it to `post.html` in the `_layouts` folder:

```

<h4 class="author-name" itemprop="author" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Person">{{ site.author }}</h4>
              on
              <time datetime="{{ page.date | date: "%F %R" }}">{{ page.date | date_to_string }}</time>
               - {{ page.content | number_of_words }} Words - {{ content | reading_time_as_i }}.
            </div>
```
