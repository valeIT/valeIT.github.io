title: Why Choosing Jekyll
---

The top 4 entries in the list are great choices and you can't go wrong with any of them.

In the end, I chose Jekyll for multiple reasons:

1. Community
   It's the framework with the wider adoption. A history of consistent updates over a decade (it was launched in 2008) and most activity on Github. It might be that in the future newer frameworks will overtake it and if that's the case it might be worth migrating, but for now, Jekyll is still the king.

2. Automatic integration with Github
   Github Pages runs on Jekyll with almost no setup. I could simply host my website there and have all the goodies of Github included for free. Otherwise would have been forced to use two different services instead of one: Github to host the code and Netlify to host the site. I tend to avoid that whenever possible.

3. Longevity
   It being old might be seen as a negative point of some people, and in some cases of bloated and old software it is, but I don't think this is the case. The framework is very much alive and used by most static websites, not to forget that just the fact of Github officially supporting it means a lot more people using it and more people contributing code and fixes. I know it is unlikely that any of the other 2 frameworks I was considering (Ghost and Gatsby) are going to shut down any time soon since they're both widely used.
