title: Forked a theme
---

If you've forked a theme instead, you should follow the theme's installation instructions. For example, using the [mediator](https://github.com/dirkfabisch/mediator) theme the process is as follows:

- [Fork the repo](https://github.com/dirkfabisch/mediator)
- Clone it to your local machine: `git clone https://github.com/USERNAME/mediator` [^4]
- Open Terminal.app and navigate (`cd`) to the folder: `cd mediator`
- From the Terminal run `bundle install`
- Run `jekyll serve` to generate your website
- Open your browser of choice to http://localhost:8000

"Mediator" is a medium-like theme and it's the theme that I'm currently using for my personal website. If that's not the theme for you, a good source is [Jekyll Themes](https://jekyllthemes.io/).

[^4]: If it asks if you want to add the Github IP to known hosts say yes.
