#### Footnotes and Images

Most of the footnotes and images were broken as well. There is not a quick solution for it since they are very different for each article so you'll have to go through your posts one by one to fix them.

What you can do to speed up the process though is NOT having to go through them one by one to check them. You can use TravisCI with `htmlproof` to know which articles need to be changed. Unfortunately, spotlight on OSX is terrible and even if I know the filename of what I'm looking for, it won't find any match for it. What I ended up doing is to open the site, paste the link of the article if I have it or search for it if I have the title, find out the date and search manually for it in the folder. Pretty annoying.

I only have a few hundred articles so it is still doable by hand, especially since I don't use footnotes constantly so the number of articles that needed an update were more like 10/20. If I had more it would be a problem and I might have looked for a different solution.
