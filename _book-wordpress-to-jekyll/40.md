## Conclusion

You now have a fully functioning website with a custom domain name hosted on Github Pages. With a simple commit (and push) you can add content. Additionally, you're going to have all the changes tracked so you can easily revert back in case of mistakes or keep track of when you made a particular change.

On top of that if you've also configured Cloudflare and Netlify you added the ability of having a live preview of your website before publishing each change, strong DOS protection, realistic (and privacy friendly) analytics, and free HTTPS.
