There are a few bots that are useful and will take away some struggle with managing the low level details of the website that we don't care about. These bots are free and available for both open source (public) and private repositories.

Before starting we need to get familiar with Pull Requests. These bots will not automatically commit a new update to your website, but will open a pull request: A request for a change to be integrated into your website. It is your responsibility to go ahead and merge it into the website by clicking merge.

# Adding a bot

To add a bot you open the link or search the Github marketplace for it and authorize access to your account. Most of the time you will be able to select the name of the repository to limit access to as well. Once added they usually don't need any additional configuration, but if they do I will point it out.

# Dependency Management

This bot will take care of updating the software that runs your website automatically.

# Image Optimization

Cropping and optimizing the images we upload for the web takes a lot of time, this bot will check all the images on your website and compress them without losing quality.
