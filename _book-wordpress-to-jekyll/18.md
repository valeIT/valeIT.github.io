<a name="#site-structure"></a>
Open `_config.yml` and set up basic information for your website, on top of most of the configuration details:

NOTE: For the images you can check the average dimension they should be by going to `assets/images`

- **`gems:`** : Plugins in use
- **`title`** : The title of your website
- **`description`** : The "motto" that will appear right under the title
- **`email`** : Your email
- **`logo`** : The image to be used as the logo
- **`cover`** : The image to be used as the cover image
- **`name`** : Your name or pseudonym
- **`author`** : Your name or pseudonym, or the name of the default writer for the site
- **`author_image`** : Your picture (small)
- **`paginate`** : The number of articles per page
- **`url`** : The URL of your website (root URL)
- **`baseurl`** : The URL for your Jekyll site (usually empty `baseurl: ""`, fill it in if you want only a folder of your site to be managed by Jekyll)
- **`twitter_handle`** : Your Twitter handle, starting with `@` (not the URL)
- **`social`** : For each social link you want to add you'll need to add the following snippet:

````
  - icon:    twitter
    url:    https://twitter.com/valentinourbano
    desc: Follow me on twitter
    share_url:
    share_title:
    share_link:
    ```
    icon:  The icon to use, go to [FontAwesome](https://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/icons/) to find all the names (For example `github` will become an icon with the GitHub logo).
url: The URL of your social profile
description: It will appear while hovering
share_ : If you want to automatically prefill a tweet or a youtube post with some information

Notice that this can be used also with non-social links if you want. I've done something similar here using the apple icon to link to [my apps](http://www.valentinourbano.com/apps):
````

- icon: apple
  url: /apps
  desc: Check out my apps
  share_url:
  share_title:
  share_link:

```

- **`permalink`** : Which kind of permalink you want for your articles. Default is `/year/month/day/title.html`, I changed it to `/title.html` using: `permalink: /:title.html`. You could also add a `/blog/title.html` if you prefer, doing so: `permalink: /blog/:title.html`
