It is now time to think about the code of your website. Do you want it to be available for everyone to look at or do you want it to be private. Github now supports private repositories, but some advanced features are limited on them if you're using the free plan. That said assuming you are not using some custom Github automation technique your Jekyll website can be private and it will work just fine. The same principle applies for Gitlab repositories as well.

In the rest of the book we are going to assume that the repository is public or that you're using a paid plan. This will allow us to explore a few advanced topics that would have not been available otherwise.

If you decided to keep it public it is a nice practice to include a `README` and a `LICENSE` files at the root of the repository.

In the README you could just include a link to this guide, or write something specific to your website. I've simply included a link to the website and some statistics about the most recent build.

For the LICENSE I licensed the code as MIT and the articles as Creative Commons (read the actual LICENSE file for the updated and valid licenses). If you are unsure on what license to use [you can find out more about it here](http://choosealicense.com).
