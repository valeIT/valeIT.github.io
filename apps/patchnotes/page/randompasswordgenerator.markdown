title: Random Password Generator Patch Notes
---

## 1.3

- NEW: Nuova Localizzazione in Italiano. Essendo Italiano mi è dispiaciuto non poter offrire la localizzazione per il rilascio. Se notate qualcosa fuori posto fatemelo sapere ;)
- NEW: Dodano lokalizację w języku polskim. Wszelkie błędy proszę zgłaszać poprzez użycie opcji "wyślij opinię". 
- NEW: Added Knowledge Base section in Settings -> Support
- NEW: Added a fast "Copy to Clipboard" button to copy the newly generated password with just one tap.
- NEW: Added support for generating a customizable password. Just pick the components you want from Settings! (Want even more options? Let me know by opening a ticket in-app!)
- NEW: iOS9 Support!

- NEW: WatchOS2 Support! 

[**NOTICE**: This will break compatibility with WatchKit (AKA WatchOS1). If you are still on WatchKit refrain from updating until you upgrade to WatchOS2!!]
