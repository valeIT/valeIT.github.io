Teria let's you write notes quickly.


[From Fall App Updates][3]:
> Teria is a minimal note taking app that opens directly into the editor ready to type in. I use it to jolt down ideas all the time. On top of that it offers a calendar with streaks to see how much you've written each day.


## Write Instantly

Most note apps force you to go through multiple screens to be able to write. With Teria you just need to open the app and it automatically starts a new note with the cursor blinking, waiting for your input. When you come back to out again you will find your note waiting.

[Customizable from Settings]

## Steak

You can pick a word Target for you to reach each day and the app will always show you how far away are you from revving it and how many days in a row you've reached it

[Customizable from Settings]

## Calendar View

Easily see how much and what you've written each day through the calendar view.


**Key Features:**

- Write as soon as you open the app
- Search through all your notes using full text search
- Track your writing through the weeks and months using the calendar view
- Get motivated to write by keeping a streak
- Easily export notes
- Rich text support
