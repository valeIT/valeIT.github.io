## 1.2.3

- FIX: Fixed a crash on all versions -\> Code Signing


## 1.2.2

- NEW: Added option to also show the internal IP address.  
- FIX: Fixed a crash on El. Captain (ATS)

##1.2


Update 1.2 Fixes a critical issue with all versions of IPLocation that causes the internet connection to appear as offline.

IPLocation and IPLocation Mini v 1.2 are available NOW for Direct Customers. MAS version has been submitted for review on November 15 (for both IPLocation and IPLocation Mini).

**Mini ONLY:**  

- Fixed a crash when accessing preferences under certain conditions.

### 1.1.2

- FIX: Fixed a bug loading the app for the non MAS version.

### 1.1.1

- FIX: Fixed a bug when the internet connection was offline.

### 1.1

- Fixed a visual bug in the Preferences where the "play sound when notification changes" was shown as enabled when it was not.  
- The Preferences Window got a name, surprise surprise, it's Preferences. Being called "Window" made it sad =(  
- FIX: Fixed a bug while network setting (Thanks for the ticket ^.^)  
- I'd like to thank everyone for the system traces that you sent in, they really helped in figuring out the problem.

- Nuova Localizzazione in Italiano. Essendo Italiano mi è dispiaciuto non poter offrire la localizzazione per il rilascio. Se notate qualcosa fuori posto fatemelo sapere ;)  
- Dodano lokalizację w języku polskim. Wszelkie błędy proszę zgłaszać poprzez użycie opcji "wyślij opinię".

**Only full**  

- Non MAS Version Launched! 
  
The link from the app page will bring you to the Online Store. The two versions are almost identical, but there are a few features limited to the Online Store version (because of Apple restrictions for the MAS).  

**Only Mini**  

- Please mind that I'm trying to keep a consistent versioning between the Mini and the Full version, that's the reason for the bump from 1.0 to 1.1 (there has been a 1.0.1 and 1.0.2 resolved a few issues only present in the Full Version of IPLocation =) ).


## Introducing IPLocation

I first released IPLocation on the Mac App Store in the beginning of September, my plan since way before it got released was to eventually have 2 versions and have both available to be bought directly AND using the MAS.

Today I'm proud to announce that IPLocation is available in the following formats:  

- IPLocation via Mac App Store  
- IPLocation via my Online Store  
- IPLocation Mini via my Online Store
