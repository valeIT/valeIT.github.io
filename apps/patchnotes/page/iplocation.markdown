title: IPLocation Patch Notes
---

## 2.0
- NEW: Added failbacks to always have a location even during service interruptions
- FIX: Improved support for High Sierra

## 1.4

- NEW: Added the ability to copy the internal IP to clipboard
- NEW: Added a second kind of flags (available from Preferences). Please note that not all countries are available. If your location flag is not available, it will automatically switch to the default kind of flag. Note that the image gets updated only if your IP changes to limit battery consumption, so you might need to restart the app if you want the change to be shown right away.

## 1.2


Update 1.2 Fixes a critical issue with all versions of IPLocation that causes the internet connection to appear as offline.

IPLocation and IPLocation Mini v 1.2 are available NOW for Direct Customers. MAS version has been submitted for review on November 15 (for both IPLocation and IPLocation Mini).

**Mini ONLY:**  

- Fixed a crash when accessing preferences under certain conditions.

### 1.1.2

- FIX: Fixed a bug loading the app for the non MAS version.

### 1.1.1

- FIX: Fixed a bug when the internet connection was offline.

### 1.1

- Fixed a visual bug in the Preferences where the "play sound when notification changes" was shown as enabled when it was not.  
- The Preferences Window got a name, surprise surprise, it's Preferences. Being called "Window" made it sad =(  
- FIX: Fixed a bug while network setting (Thanks for the ticket ^.^)  
- I'd like to thank everyone for the system traces that you sent in, they really helped in figuring out the problem.

- Nuova Localizzazione in Italiano. Essendo Italiano mi è dispiaciuto non poter offrire la localizzazione per il rilascio. Se notate qualcosa fuori posto fatemelo sapere ;)  
- Dodano lokalizację w języku polskim. Wszelkie błędy proszę zgłaszać poprzez użycie opcji "wyślij opinię".

**Only full**  

- Non MAS Version Launched! 
  
The link from the app page will bring you to the Online Store. The two versions are almost identical, but there are a few features limited to the Online Store version (because of Apple restrictions for the MAS).  

**Only Mini**  

- Please mind that I'm trying to keep a consistent versioning between the Mini and the Full version, that's the reason for the bump from 1.0 to 1.1 (there has been a 1.0.1 and 1.0.2 resolved a few issues only present in the Full Version of IPLocation =) ).


## 1.0

- Initial Release

## Introducing IPLocation

I first released IPLocation on the Mac App Store in the beginning of September, my plan since way before it got released was to eventually have 2 versions and have both available to be bought directly AND using the MAS.

Today I'm proud to announce that IPLocation is available in the following formats:  

- IPLocation via Mac App Store  
- IPLocation via my Online Store  
- IPLocation Mini via my Online Store
