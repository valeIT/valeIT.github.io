# Free My Desktop - Free Mac App\n\n<div> <article><div> Article Image\n\n Article Image\n\n<div><div>Blog Logo\n\n#### Valentino Urbano\n\n on\n\n<time datetime=\" 2018-09-29 14:43 \">29 Sep 2018<\/time>\\- 497 Words\n\n<\/div> <\/div> <\/div> <section> <span><\/span> read\n\n <a name=\"topofpage\"><\/a>Lately I’ve been doing some screen recordings and screenshots for some projects and I had the necessity of making a quick tool to hide everything from the desktop to make it look neat.\n\n![Free My Desktop](/assets/article_images/freemydesktop_screen_1.jpeg)\n\n## Free My Desktop\n\nThe screenshot above was created with Free My Desktop.\n\nIt automatically hides all the icons from your desktop, the dock and the menubar.\n\nThe app lives in the menubar itself so you can toggle ‘focus mode’ on and off as you please with a simple click.\n\nThe app is completely free, but I’d glad if you would [consider donating towards a cup of freshly roasted italian coffee](https://www.paypal.me/vale93).\n\n![Free My Desktop](/assets/article_images/freemydesktop_screen_2.jpeg)\n\n## [Download the App](/apps/mac/freemydesktop/)\n\nIf you have tips or suggestions you can also find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/valentinourbano).\n\n![Free My Desktop](/assets/article_images/freemydesktop_screen_3.jpeg)\n\n## Installation and Requirements\n\nThe app requires OS X Yosemite or newer to run. I tried to keep it backward compatible as much as I could, but it’s not tested on any system apart Mojave (let me know if there are problems on any older systems).\n\nThere is no installer, you can just drag and drop it in your Application folder and double click to open.\n\nIt is signed with my developer ID (also notarized by Apple). The only warning popup that should appear is the one telling you that you downloaded this app from the internet and not from the App Store.\n\n**If you have problems opening the app the first time:**\n\nIf you have Gatekeeper (most recent Mac have it) and allow only applications from the Mac App Store to run you need to open “System Preferences” -> “Security & Privacy” -> “Allow apps downloaded from” -> click the logck and enter your password and select “App Store and identified developers”.\n\n![Free My Desktop](/assets/article_images/freemydesktop_screen_inst.jpeg)\n\nYou can now open the app.\n\nNote: Unfortunately, due to Apple Sandboxing the app is not and will never be available through the Mac App Store.\n\nIf you enjoyed it consider buying me a coffee.\n\n \n[![](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/assets/img/BMC-btn-logo.svg)<span>Buy me a coffee<\/span>](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/valentino)\n\n[Press Kit](/apps/mac/freemydesktop/presskit.html)\n\n <\/section><div><div>##### <span>Written by<\/span>\n\n <section>Blog Logo\n\n#### Valentino Urbano\n\n- - - - - -\n\nPublished <time datetime=\" 2018-09-29 14:43 \">29 Sep 2018<\/time>\n\n <\/section> <\/div> <\/div> <article> <\/article> <\/article><\/div>
