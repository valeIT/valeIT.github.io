My name is Valentino Urbano and I live in between Poland and Italy with my wife. 

## Projects

I'm currently working full time, mainly developing apps for iOS.  I'm also developing web applications (mainly backend and databases) and working in DevOps. 

I've been writing online since 2007 and had a website since 2009. I currently write on my [Blog](/) and occasionally on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/valentinourbano). 

When I have time, I work on some [personal projects](/projects), write and play guitar. 

For information about professional projects check out the [work page](/work) and/or send me an email. If you'd like a copy of my CV, just send an email my way. 

## Tools

My current machine is a 2015 12-inch MacBook Pro. Before I've used an 11-inch MacBook Air and an old 15.6-inch Acer Aspire.

This site uses [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) running on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com) with a custom domain.

I use Byword to write short prose, Scrivener for longer essays. To code I mainly use Visual Studio Code and Xcode.
