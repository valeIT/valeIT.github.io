My name is Valentino Urbano and I live in between Poland and Italy with my wife.

## Projects

I'm currently working full time as Freelancer, mainly developing apps for iOS, web applications (frontend and backend) and DevOps.

I've been writing online since 2007 and had a website since 2009. I currently write on my [Blog](/) and occasionally on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/valentinourbano).

When I have time, I work on some [personal projects](/projects) and play guitar.

For information about professional projects check out the [work page](/work). If you want more information or would like a copy of my CV send an email my way.

## Tools

My current machine is a 2018 15-inch MacBook Pro. Before I've used an 2015 12-inch MacBook Pro, an 11-inch MacBook Air and an old 15.6-inch Acer Aspire.

This site uses [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) running on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com) with a custom domain.

I use Byword to write short prose, Scrivener for longer essays.

To code I mainly use Visual Studio Code and Xcode.
