My name is Valentino Urbano and I live in Poland with my wife.

## Projects

I'm currently working full time as Freelancer, mainly developing apps for iOS. On the side I also dabble in Android, web (frontend and backend) and DevOps.

I've been writing online since 2007 and had a website since 2009. I  ~~currently ~~ write on my [Blog](/) and occasionally on [Twitter][1].

In the past I've run multiple websites and forums:
- [Learning Flutter](https://learningflutter.netlify.com)
- Anything Apple
- simpleplan.it
- My Simple Romance

When I have time, I work on some [personal projects](/projects) and play guitar.

For information about professional projects check out my [work page](/work). If you want more information or would like a copy of my CV send an email my way.

## Tools

My current machine is a 2022 M1 Pro MacBook Pro. Before I've used a 2018 15-inch MacBook Pro, a 2015 12-inch MacBook Pro, an 11-inch MacBook Air and an old 15.6-inch Acer Aspire.

This site uses [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) running on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com) with a custom domain.

I use Visual Studio Code to write short prose, Scrivener for longer essays.

To code I mainly use Xcode (for Apple platforms), Android Studio (for Android) and Visual Studio Code (for everything else).
