My name is Valentino Urbano and I live in between Poland and Italy. I'm currently working full time developing apps for iOS. I also write on my Blog and occasionally on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/valentinourbano). 

[You can take a look at the projects I'm working on here](/projects).

You can contact me via email at <a href="mailto:valentino@valentinourbano.com">valentino@valentinourbano.com</a>. Please note that this is a personal email address, if you need to contact me for other reasons use the [Support Page](/support/). Support emails received on my personal email address will be ignored. 

If you'd like a copy of my CV, just send an email my way. 

I read every email that I get, but I can't assure that I will respond to every one of them. I'm sorry.

You can find the source code for this site on [Github](https://github.com/valeIT/valeIT.github.io). If you find anything wrong I'd be glad if you'd consider [opening an Issue](https://github.com/valeIT/valeIT.github.io/issues) or [submitting a pull request](https://github.com/valeIT/valeIT.github.io/pulls).
