Your situation may also be different from mine.

**Always talk with your tax advisor.**

## In general

I'm obviously not:

- A lawyer.
- A financial advisor.
- A tax advisor.

I usually talk from my experience. Yours may differ. **Don't take my (or anyone's) word at face value.**

Always research and be wary.
