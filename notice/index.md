## For Freelance articles

Please be advised, this is not advice.

Your situation may also be different from mine.

Always talk with your tax advisor.

## In general

I'm obviously not:

* A lawyer.
* A financial advisor.
* A tax advisor.

I usually talk from my experience. Yours may differ. **Don't take my (or anyone's) word at face value.**

Always research and always be wary.
