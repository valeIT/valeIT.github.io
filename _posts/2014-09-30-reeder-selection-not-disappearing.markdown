I found a peculiar (minor) bug in reeder for iPhone.

If you select some text on an article and scroll down to the next via gesture, it keeps it selected. If you slide up slightly, not enough to switch back to the previous article, but enough to show the title of such article sliding in there will be giant a blue dot in the top left corner of the screen, marking the end of the selection.
