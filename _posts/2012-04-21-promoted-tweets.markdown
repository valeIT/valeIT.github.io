Finally also Twitter is [rolling out][0] a proper business model, i see it as a great opportunity for them to stay in business. If you only provide a free service and you have no plan on how make money you'll probably go out of business in few months if you don't find a [VC ][1]to found you or if you don't end up[bought][2] by a bigger company.

Remember the main focus of a company should be making money, if they make money you can be sure that they won't drop the development so i really can't understand all those complaints about it. I do understand that Ads are ugly[^1], but you can't pretent that a free service don't rely on advertisement to keep going.

If you really don't won't ads you'd be willing to pay, that's the business model of [Instapaper][4] and [Pinboard][5] and they're doing great, they have no problem at all.

[^1]: I think that too, but the way they've developed it, integrated in the timeline is actually fine for me.
