[Best of Reddit - Introduction:][0]

> There are so many great threads on reddit, every single day, but soon they disappear into the void - for the very nature of reddit itself. This is a place to save what I find most "useful" in a given week.
> 
> I'd bet that the quality of this panel is gonna vary a lot on a week by week basis, but I hope that overall it's gonna be worthwile --- you'll be the judge of that.

These posts have never been a top 10 (in the literal sense of the term), so I'm changing the list from a numbered one to bullets (•) --- as it was in the very first issue --- to make clear that it's a non ordered list.

• Writing Prompt - [An atheist meets Jesus][1]

• [Objective comparison between Hitler and Stalin][2]

• [Fox steals GIF, author edits it, hilarity ensues][3]

Nowadays not even mainstream publications are a safe harbor against plagiarism. So sad.

• [Some computers are sentient and fear the IT guy][4]

• [Specifics on how to become a chess master ][5]

You are a new chess player and you are certain to win every match, how long would it take to reach world 1st?  
Answer: just short of 2 years.

• [In depth analysis of people posting hairstyles on Instagram][6]

Including countless links to different hairstyles and comments on them.

• [2008 crisis, explained][7]

Quick in-depth explanation. (It missed a few points explained in further comments).

• [People are mental, nothing else to say.][8]

If you don't realize that when you put a fantasy into the real world you need to understand the conseguences, I don't know what to tell you.

• [Missconceptions regarding airplaines - debuked][9]

I have studied aeronautics for 5 years and I can't believe some people are so clueless about it. Though I admit that I didn't know a few of them myself.

• [Sites fallen from grace][10]

A thread to remind us that one day, many of the sites we're addicted to will be gone. That's why sites like [the internet archive][11] are so important and their key place on the internet is only going to grow as more and more pages disappear into the void.

And that wraps it up, hope you like the new format and see you next week.
