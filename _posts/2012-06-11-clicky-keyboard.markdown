[I've always been attracted from this kind of _oldish_ things, in fact i currently use a mechanic keyboard or to say it a-la shawn blanc a **clicky (clacky) keyboard** \[][0][1][1][\].][0]

Personally i would like to have an apple extented 2 just to use it from time to time, but i would never use it as my primary keyboard. I live in an apartment and i can't make that much noise, but apart from that I find it disturbing, as i said I do like clicky keyboards a lot, but i can't stant listening to them the whole day, every day, i much rather prefer some music - rock music.

1. If you're planning on buying one you should consider buying it on ebay if you can find it at a reasonable price - consider also the price of the asb cable and the USB adaptor + shipping in the final price.
