I've got a tip for the google guys working at the project glass.  
Try to make it as transparent as possible. People don't like to be' discracted while doing something important.

**Follow eyes movement **  
As doctors already do everyday in hospitals google can integrate a system that can follow your eyes movement to make ui elements transarent if necessary. With nowadays technology it can't work perfectly, we're not there yet, but it'll be still better that the actual ones.
