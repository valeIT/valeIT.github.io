Here what i said few days ago on the Instagram acquisition:

> First reaction: noooooo.
> 
> Although I do hope that facebook will keep their word and keep developing Istagram indipendently, i'm really afraid it would end up as it happened with gowalla few years ago -- they disappeared.
> 
> I still hope for the best, but most of the blogosphere is sleptical: Ben Brooks has already deleted his account.
> 

I thought i had been clear enough, but from a few messages i got that doesn't seem the case.

I'd like to clarify (once for all) my position on the Instagram aquisition.

If i were the ceo of Instagram i would have done the same thing, a billion dollar is just too much money for saying no, expecially if you still - after years - don't have any business model at all.

What i did was pointing out my very first reaction, my fear for what facebook could do now. That doesn't mean i'm sure it'll happen and it doesn't mean i hate Instagram or Facebook.  
I only said that i don't trust facebook (as i don't trust google, honestly i trust google even less).

Then i pointed out the fact that Ben Brooks quitted just after the news broke; he had his [reason][0], rigt reasons from my standpoint, i don't condamn him for that, but neither approve his decision.  
I think that it's still too early to do anything, we have to take a closer look on the next move from Facebook, only then we can decide: stay or leave.

As i said if anything (including their privacy policy) won't change i have no reason to quit, it's a great app and a great service, i just love it!
