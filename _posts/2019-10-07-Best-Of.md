[Links are still not up, doing this with a static website took a bit longer than expected, see the rest of the article for details.]

Inspired by my defunct series "Best Of Reddit"[^1] where I went through reddit once a month to find the best content of the month I had the idea of keeping a log with what are my top X items in a category (for example books, movies, ...). I explain more about it in the [Best Of][1] homepage, but to make it quick, it is there mainly as a [personal wiki][2].

It is still rather empty, but you get the idea. The page about [books][3] is the only one up at the moment and the only one really populated with anything.

I took the occasion to automate the process of generating such pages from a json file. As I've written in length, my website runs Jekyll so it doesn't have a server and I can't do anything too fancy. Whatever needs generating needs to run at build time. This is totally fine for this use case since all information needed are known at build time. I can have one json file for each category and have a script that given those files can generate a page for it. Luckily there is already a jekyll plugin that does just that: [datapage-gen][4].

[Next up we are going to configure the plugin to generate the various pages]
