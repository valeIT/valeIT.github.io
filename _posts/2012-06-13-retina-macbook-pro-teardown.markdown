[The guys from iFix it have already disassembled the new MacBook Pro, but unfortunately the site is currently down.][0](Thanks to 512 pixels for the link.)

I didn't break my hiatus for WWDC, but i need to post some thoughts on the new macbook pro, because it's just awesome.

I think no one was expecting such a revolutionary product: of course the retina display was predicted, as the SSD on a Macbook Pro, as ivy bridge cpus, but all those improvements together is just a game changing in the industry.

I love apple for this, not the new mac itself (also), but i love them mainly for their mentality. Even though they are currently the leader [^1] they don't stop pushing hard on innovation, both on iOs and on Mac OsX.

[^1]: Some might argue that Mac OsX has just a 15% of the Pc market at the moment, but Aple is the only manifactury that keeps gaining share at the same pace month after month, all the others are shrinking.
