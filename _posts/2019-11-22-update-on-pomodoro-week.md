# Update on "Pomodoro Week"

I haven't given an update on the whole using the [pomodoro technique to fight blue eyes fatigue][1].

This is Part 3, you should first read [Part 1][11] and [Part 2][12].

I thought I had found a good application for it, but it doesn't always work. Sometimes it skips a period and you don't really realize that since you're usually too focused on what you're doing to notice. I've used it for a few weeks, but it was just not worth it. There were more the times it failed than the ones it notified of the break.

I just can't find a decent application for it. A few of the problems from most applications I've tried:

- They require manual intervention.
- They're too bloated with features I don't need.
- They don't work 100% of the times.
- They don't start automatically.

So I have called it quits with apps for now until I get find something good for my needs. At the moment I don't have the time to develop something like this myself, but if I can't find anything I may consider it in the future (no promises).

What I'm doing now is a bit less scientifically sound, but better than nothing.

I keep a small glass of water on my desk and every hour of so I go and fill it. It is unreasonable to think that the amount of times between each refill is cnstant or even close to a baseline and surely it happens way less often than the recommended 20 minutes, but it is something.

The water dispenser is on the opposite side of the office from my room (there is one closer, but I skip it on purpose) so on top of being good for my eyes I have to walk a bit. If you combine this to the [standing desk][2] and [the treadmill][3] they all compound.
