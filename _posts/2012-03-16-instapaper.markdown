You know, i've tried Readability for few weeks now, but i finally switched back to Instapaper. Why?

_The problem is that I can't separate the service from its founder._

[Marco Arment][0] is a great guy, i admire him (and if you listen weekly to [build and analyze][1] you would too). I almost felt like i was betraying him. I know it's weird, but i'm not the [only][2] [one][3].

Update\#1: I'm not saying that readability is a bat app, I like it too, it's just that I prefer Instapaper.

Update\#2: Instapaper has just been updated to 4.1 with great new features. It's worth a try.
