If you're like me you surely read a lot of "meta" blog about writing when you feel like you're hopeless and stuck. While content there is usually great you shouldn't hunker down on it.

As for everything don't use all suggestions as a mantra. Develop your own habits and follow those.

Use other's flow and experiences as an inspiration to build your own. Learn from their experiences, but don't stop there. What might have worked for someone else doesn't necessarily mean it'll work for you verbatim.

Adapt it, meld it to your specific flow and then share it with the world, cause you never know if someone else might learn something from it.

You know yourself better than anyone else so you know what works for you and what doesn't. Don't keep doing something you know won't work. Forcing it on yourself is only going to make you lose motivation and fail.

We bring our personal feelings and experiences with us and they reflect in our writing.

Having a varied, engaging and happy life is key. I you don't get ideas to go out and experience the world more, you will get them.
