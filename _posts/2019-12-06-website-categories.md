I'm mostly writing about technology and programming in particular. I plan to continue this trend in the future.

That doesn't mean that my blog is only limited to those topics as the main argument. It represents what I like so it can and will shift over time since I don't like to have different blogs for different areas. It should be the one place where anyone ([me included][1]) can find (almost) everything that I write online.

I try to vary and write about a lot of different topics. I do not want my blog to be e thematic. I want it to be a reflection of who i am and what i find interesting in life.

This way though it is hard for someone who is interested in only one topic to follow only what they're interested in since I post daily and I might go a long time talking only about one topic and ignoring the rest.

I have categories that should help with that, but I have them being very general (by choice). For example I have a category called programming, but I do not have a category called unity of swift even though I cover both topics with more than just a few articles.

I still don't know how to solve this problem effectively since I do not want to pollute the categories page with 15+ different entries. I feel like that would ruin the whole point of that a category should be. The number of categories should be limited and adding one should only be done after thinking over it for a while.

For now you can use search since I try to add the name of the technology in the title most of the times, but that's not always the case. I hope I can find something a bit better.
