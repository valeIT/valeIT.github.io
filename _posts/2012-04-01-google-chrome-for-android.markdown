I've just updated my hp touchpad to ice cream sandwich and the first thing i've done on the new os was downloading chrome (which is only compatible with ICS).

I used int for a few days, here's few screenshoot of the app running on my hp touchpad.

**Beta**

It was marked as 'beta', i thought about siri and all the customers indignation about Apple releasing a beta sotware (which works by the way) and i was like ok i'll give it a try anyway.

Installed smootly, let's go.

I had been surfing for almost an hour when chrome froze, later on i found out that it was because of a youtube video. Google has release a browser that doesn't even work with its own services.

And i haven't heard anyone yet complaining about it, because you know, it's still in beta!

It's not a huge problem you could expect such a thing from a beta version, but what matters is that  if they haven't shout at Apple i wouldn't even mind to  write something about it, but they did. That's my response.
