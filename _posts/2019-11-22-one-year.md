365 Days have passed since I started writing one post a day[^1]. It is impressive to see how it all compounds. Most of the visists to my websites are from posts written . during this year even though they're all pretty short. 
I had to choose between consistency and writing long form and I chose the former. The latter gives way better results with search engines and because of that a lot more traffic, but that doesn't mean that short content is pointless. It will just get less views from Google. 

That said, I've always been a believer that if you're writing to get views or rank on Google you should go and do something else. If you do that as your day job it is fine, but if writing is an hobby your main goal should be the craft and improving your skills. You don't notice it a lot on a day to day basis, but when you look back after 6 months to a year you will see a huge difference on how your approached things back then and how you approach them now. This is true not only for writing, but more in general.

## Writing About Writing[^2]

I wanted to take a few moments to list what I think are the best posts about writing that I've written this year. They are not a lot since the bulk of my articles are about tech and programming, but they are not so few either:

- [Writing Ideas][1]
- [Two Weeks of Writing][2]
- [Writing Time][3]
- [Writing Every Day][4]
- [Consistency In Writing][5]
- [Writing Inspiration][6]
- [Writing Long Form][7]
- [Scripting and Writing][8]
- [VSCode Is Great For Writing][9]
- This Article

It is interesting to see that they're spaced pretty evenly every few months.

## Writing Statistics

Now to the statistics. [200WordsADay][11] says that I have written xx words, that's an epic fantasy novel right there. It clearly shows that even writing only the minimum 200 words a day means writing 1.4k words a week, 6k words a month and 71k words a year. Surely not an epic fantasy novel, but a novel nonetheless.
I have written 338 posts since I started, a bit shy of the 356 posts, but I have written a few longer posts that took multiple days to write. I've also written a few columns and pages that don't really count as articles so I haven't included them.

## Products

While writing I had an idea for an app. I wanted to jot down ideas on the go, but I didn't like any single app available on Android for the task so I've written my own. That's how Teria was born:

- [Introducing Teria][10]
- [It's Release Day][12]

A few months ago I've released it for free on both iOS and Android.

## Ideas

How I come up with ideas has not changed during the past 12 months. [You can refer to this article for more details][1], but the gist of it is that you just get ideas naturally. If you do not that is a sign that you need to change your environment: go for a walk, drive around town, go camping, ...
How I write down ideas has changed slightly. I used to do it on the notes app on the phone, now I exclusively do it in [Teria][10] so I can keep track of which days I got ideads and which days I did not. The tool is not really that important, the most important thing is that you take care of writing down your ideas whenever they come.

## Future

I have no intention on stopping. The day may come, but for now it is far in the horizon.

[^1]: Actually we have passed that count a few days ago, but I didn't have the time to write something to give it the importance it deserved.
