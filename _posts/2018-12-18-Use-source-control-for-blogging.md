_This article is aimed at developers who are already using source control for their code and know how it works (a more general approach will come in a later post)._

Git

Git is not only useful to organize code, but it can be also used to track changes and revisions in your writing.

- Track the lifecycle of an article

- Use Blame for collaboration

- Great for editing

- Great for backup (if hosted)

- Ability to use git diff

Bonus

- If you're using Github or Gitlab Pages the flow is pretty similar.

Private

If you don't want to post your drafts in public you can use a private repository.

Some great websites that support private repository:

- Github

It offers unlimited free public repositories for everyone. Private repositories are paid (free for students)

- Gitlab

Unlimited free public and private repositories for everyone. Gitlab is open source, if you have a server you can self-host it.

- Bitbucket

Unlimited free public and private repositories for everyone

Of course if you're not a developer something easier, like Google Docs, does most of the work with almost none of the complexity. For developers who already know and use git on a daily basis this is a great starting point.
