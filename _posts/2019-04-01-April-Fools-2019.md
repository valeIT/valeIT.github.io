April Fools

I don't like doing April fools so I'd rather not. That does not mean that I don't like reading all of the hilarious things floating around the net today. The best ones are the ones that are hilarious but are also real. A few examples of great products that came out on April 1st are the 1.1.1.1 DNS last year from Cloudflare and Gmail from Google 15 years ago (can't believe that Gmail turns 15 today).

I have nothing against people doing their own April fools. The only thing to keep in mind is that person/people on the receiving end should also be laughing at the end. If it makes them feel bad it is not a good joke and you shouldn't have made it in the first place.

Some of the best pranks this year:
