[Best of Reddit - Introduction:][0]

> There are so many great threads on reddit, every single day, but soon they disappear into the void - for the very nature of reddit itself. This is a place to save what I find most "useful" in a given week.
> 
> I'd bet that the quality of this panel is gonna vary a lot on a week by week basis, but I hope that overall it's gonna be worthwile --- you'll be the judge of that.

We're back, after the Christmas holidays in great style. I hope you enjoyed the 2014 special and happy new year everyone (a bit late, I know).

• [Saga fall from grace][1]

How the death of game xx killed sega.

• [The real threat of terrorism][2]

It's already happening, at least the fact of trying to alienate people against Muslims. The most conservative ones are doing it

• [Bizarre Wills][3]

Some people are just cruel...

• [Best free stuff online][4]

The best are all the learning material available for everyone (and mostly for free). It's great that you can find all the knowledge you'd ever hoped for with just a few clicks

• [Staged answers for Nissan AMA][5] and gets [debuked by a mod][6]

Seems like they're using film accounts to answer the question they would like to receive. Seems like they're legit, maybe the story will develop further.

• [How it is to be poor][7]

• [Conqueror of the Earth][8]

• [Debuking imaginary bands][9]

Who made imaginary shows in famous locations and even have imaginary contracts with music labels.

• [I'm living in a movie][10]

Not a good movie unfortunately...

• [Steam on Linux deletes system root][11]
