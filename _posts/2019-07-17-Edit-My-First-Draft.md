I'm going to try something different today.

As I've written on the 200WaD Slack channel it would be nice if people could edit each other's stories. I'll bite.

I'm writing a post about writing. The first draft is available on Google Docs for anyone to comment on and critique.

[https://docs.google.com/document/d/14UwJ8hXjvtQr3QEzyU7iQIGfodKKW83qc2fN1nBoKUA/edit?usp=sharing][1]

It's a 'guide' for aspiring writers. I explore what worked for me, how to get ideas[^1], how to write your first draft and I touch slightly on how to edit it. I'm planning to write a different article about editing since it's a big topic.

Feel free, to be honest. I don't bite. I also won't take anything personally. Mostly let me know if it's something anyone would be interested in for the future. While we wait for Basile (not a complaint obviously, software development takes time) we could start critiquing our own work. Obviously, we are not editors, but we're still a different pair of eyes than who wrote the story. That usually can catch many problems and mistakes that get overlooked.

The Google Docs is going to be up for 7 days. After that, I plan to publish it on my [website][2] and here.

Thanks for taking the time to read it and feel free to share yours with the community.
