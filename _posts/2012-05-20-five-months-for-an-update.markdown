Jean-Baptiste Queru, the lead of the Android Open Source Project [stated][0]:

> Queru actually thinks the five months it took Sony to update the tablet from 3.0 Honeycomb to 4.0 Ice Cream Sandwich is "very reasonable," as the two Android versions are "quite different" under the hood. He also adds that the differences between Gingerbread and Ice Cream Sandwich are huge, and so phone upgrades are likely to take longer.

[I really don't think it's OK.][1]
