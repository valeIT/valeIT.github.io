Federico Viticci (the man behind macstories) was [interview ][0]by Matt Alexander and he made few important thoughts.

> We knew a simple, natural way of [creating memories][1] was possible through technology.
> 
> \[...\]
> 
> So we were there on a Friday night, drinking our usual beers, and I noticed at least three of them were naturally switching between apps (WhatsApp, iMessage, Facebook, Instagram) as we were talking. They were not excluded from the conversation: they were simply interacting with their devices in the background. They didn't say "Hey, check out that girl over there" --- and I swear this is 100% true --- they were browsing Facebook profiles instead (that's not to say they don't look at girls --- they will never lose that habit for better or worse).
> 
> Initially I thought my friends were "weird" for doing that. But as I reflected on it, I figured that all people of my same age are like that now, boys and girls, no difference.
> 
> \[...\]
> 
> And like I said above, all these innovations will have one common denominator: our happiness. Improving the quality of our lifestyles, institutions, commutes, and social interactions will only be consequences of our basic desire for more time to dedicate to ourselves and the ones we love.

You should read the whole interview if you have the time.
