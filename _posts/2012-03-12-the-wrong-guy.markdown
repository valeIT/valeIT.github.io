I've just finished to read the biography of Steve Jobs  by Walter Isaacson - honestly it seems more like the history of Apple, but i do admit that they're strongly related.

I've taken the time to listen again to two great episodes of Hypercritical, an audio podcast by Dan Benjamin and John Siracusa  (on 5by5):

* [\#42: The Wrong Guy][0]
* [\#43: The Scorpion and the Frog][1]

They've gone straight to the point, unfortunately Steve Jobs picked up the wrong guy. The main problem illustrated by John Siracusa is that Isaacson didn't take the effort to dig deep inside about (too) many situations.

He had in just few occasions, but since he was the only one to have full access  to Steve Jobs' memories \[[1][2]\] we've lost the only opportunity to have a complete biography - for ever.

1\. I do understand it's a really bad way to say it, but this is it.
