Youtube is the new  television.

We are proud not to spend so much time in front of the television as the previous generation did, but we are only fooling ourselves.

The media has changed, but the behavior is still there.

Instead of the black box we now watch youtube, twitch or now mixer, but the end result is the same.

We spend a lot of time getting fed content from a screen. We can choose what content we consume way easier than the previous generation could with a television, but we are still passive consumers. Stopping entirely is not a viable solution, some offtime is needed from time to time, but we should be careful and wary on how much time we really spend there.

It would be nice if Google offered a way to track how much time you spend on youtube, but since you can't you can either track it using a time tracking software that aggregates the time per website if you're good at setting limits for yourself, or using a software that blocks certain websites after an amount of hours if you're not.
