I've been using Swift for close to 7 month now and I've seen all kind of weirdness[1][0]. Every time I catch something odd or interesting I try to take a note about it. Over time I got a nice collection of those notes [2][1]. 

Those are not only funny errors in Swift, but more often simple notes on how to do something I wasn't sure about --- usually easy stuff that I tend to forget about if I'm not using that specific part of the language/framework enough. The first note about enumerating enums is coming up later today, expect more in the future.

1. I know, I know, there is still **a lot** more to be seen. Always more.[↩][2]
2. 
If there is interest I'll be happy to most more of them.[↩][3]
