When I was a teen I had a lot of free time after school, way more than I have now working a full time job.

Most kids my age used to go out and drink. I used to stay home and read. I would also play computer games from time to time, but not as often as I would be reading.

In these last few months I'm still trying to read whenever I can, but up to last year I would only read one or two books a year. This year I've read 5 books so far and I'm on track to read at least one more by the end of the year. I could read way more if I forced myself to, but I don't want to force it too much.

Reading needs to be something that you enjoy doing and you like doing, not something that you do just because you set a number of books to read in a specific timeframe.

You need to read with an open mind and will. Having a forced limit is counterproductive to that objective.
