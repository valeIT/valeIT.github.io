I don't know if it's a recent trend or not, but there are so many publications online that just care about keeping you on the page. That would not be a problem if the means in which they do so is by creating great long-form content that you just can't wait to read in full. Unfortunately, a lot of publications don't take the time to do that and instead opt for the easy way of turning a short on to the point article onto a 10k word story by just adding fluff.

If you just wrote a guide on how to unlock an iPad from a User's perspective and you took 10k words + to do it, I'm sorry, but I'm not going to bother reading it. Just give me the few sentences I need and I'll be out of the way.

If you need to spend 10k words because your guide on how to unlock it goes in depth into the internals of how it works or what to do if you accidentally get locked out of it that's fair game. But if you take 10k words to just say:

1. Do you have Face Id? Look at the screen. If it doesn't work press the side button and look at the screen.
2. Do you (still) have a physical home button? Press it.
3. Are you on an old version of iOS? Press a button (either the side button or home button will do) and swipe to the right (or to the left if you're in an RTL country) to unlock.

You should step up your game.

Sincerely,
Valentino.
