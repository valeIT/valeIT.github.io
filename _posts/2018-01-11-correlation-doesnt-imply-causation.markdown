At every social meeting this topic comes up. I might be stuck with it, but I've seen so many people that don't understand it.

## Post hoc ego propter hoc 
(aka Correlation Doesn't Imply Causation)

The basic idea is simple:

Just because something happened that is related to another event. It doesn't mean that it was caused by it.

From my experience everyone understands and accepts that statement, but when you go and you apply it to actual facts bias take precedence.

A simple traveler's example that is obvious to everyone is a fallacy:
"Just right as I arrived in my new apartment a window broke, therefore it's my fault it did."
Wheter if you actually look at the cause it might look like:
"It was hailing the whole day, the window just happened to give in at the moment I arrived."

More examples:

- [Funny examples][3]

## Denying the antecedent

This thought causes people to avoid doing whatever they were doing when the bad thing happened so that it doesn't happen again, even though they had nothing to do with it and the same thing would have happened if they weren't doing it.
