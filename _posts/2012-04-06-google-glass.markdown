Google released a promo [video][0] of their innovative ["Project Glass"][1], but they forgot to add their main business model in it_(a hint? Ads)._

Fortunately [The Atlantic][2] has fixed it! Here's the new and improved_(?) _video of the  product.

Hilarious.

Do you really wanna be monitored by Google whenever you go? I Don't.

I also don't wanna ads that cover up all my view, what happen if i receive a notification/ad while crossing the street?

I only hope that google won't put their users first, not their main customers  (the ad companies) as they're doing nowadays with their new [privacy policy][3].
