## New MacBook

I just bought a MacBook a year ago so I'm not interested in this year's macbook pro, but if I did not I would have surely bought it. It still has many problems, but finally even at Apple, stubborn as they are, have realized that the butterfly keyboard was a complete and utter disaster.

## PROS

- Finally a keyboard that actually works when you type
It is astonishing that this needs to be in a list of pros for a laptop, but here we are. What a shame.
People say it is even better than the 2015 macbook pro keyboard and more in line with the magic keyboard, that's just great. I love the magic keyboard.

- Finally the escape key is back
Same as above.

- The touch id and off button is now more visible. I took a week to realize where it was when I bought mine.

- Great specs
You can future-proof your new macbook really well this year

- Great microphone
Finally we have a really good microphone already in our mac so during skype/slack/zoom calls we don't always have to use headphones + mic to get a decent audio. We will still need it to record a podcast or for soemthing where we want more sound fidelity, but for 99% of the times it will be good enough.

## CONS

- The Usual Prices
As always prices are off the charts, but we're unfortunately all used to it.

- Touchbar
The touchbar is still here, it seems that Apple won't go back on this. It is way worse than having physical keys and the missclicks are still a big problem. I even had to hide a few buttons so that they didn't miss fire so often.

- Ports
Again the pro mac comes with only 4 USB-C ports and everyone is forced to buy an ugly dongle. Why?

## Should You Buy It?

You should buy it in most cases since it solves most of the major issues that plagued the recent macbook line-up.
