[Good idea][0], but the biggest problem with this kind of implementation is friction. When i'm reading an article the only think i wanna be playing attention is in reading that article, i don't wanna be distracted by random words in a foreign language popping up now and then randomly in the text.

Nonetheless the idea of enriching your vocabolary while surfing the web is compelling, but developers have to find a frictionless way to implement it.

And if you're not a native speaker the best way to learn is to go to UK/Usa or Australia alone, isolated by anyone who speak your language for few months if possible.
