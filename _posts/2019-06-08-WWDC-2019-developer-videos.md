# WWDC 2019

This year's WWDC was probably the biggest in term of changes for Developers since the unveil of Swift thanks to SwiftUI. It is the future of iOS (iPadOS) and Mac development and even relegates Catalyst (Marzipan) to the background.[^1]

Other big changes for developers (apart from the new cheesegrater) are multiple window support for the iPad, dark mode for iOS and stand alone watch apps.

## Videos to Watch

I usually only watch a few videos from WWDC due to time constraints, but this year I took a few days to watch most videos.

- [Keynote](https://developer.apple.com/wwdc19/101)
  The main keynote
- [State of the Union](https://developer.apple.com/wwdc19/103)
  As for every year a more developer centric deep dive presentation
- [What's New in Swift](https://developer.apple.com/wwdc19/402)
  What's new in both Swift 5.1 and Swift 5
- [**Introducing SwiftUI: Building Your First App**](https://developer.apple.com/wwdc19/204)
  If you only watched one video (apart from the keynote itself) it should be this one. They build a complete app using swiftUI on stage
- [Creating Independent Watch Apps](https://developer.apple.com/wwdc19/208)
  How to create watch applications that don't require a companion iOS application (and how to install apps on the watch)
- [Introducting Multiple Windows on iPad](https://developer.apple.com/wwdc19/212)
  AppDelegate is now responsible for the App Lifecycle, but doesn't own a window anymore since we are going to have multiple ones.
- [Implementing Dark Mode on iOS](https://developer.apple.com/wwdc19/214)
  Best practises on how to implement dark modes on your existing iOS applications and what the system already does for yu behind the scenes.

[The list is not final, I didn't watch all the videos yet. More links coming as I watch them.]

[^1]: And thinking that we were sure Catalyst would be the star of the show...
