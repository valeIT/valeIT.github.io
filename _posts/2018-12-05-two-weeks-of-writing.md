# Two Weeks of Writing

_It's crazy how just having a tool and a commitment to do something can fuel you on doing it._

I already wrote my 200 words for today (going to keep them for a day I'm really busy), but I wanted to write more. And it has just been two weeks.

On the word count

After two weeks, putting words out it's becoming easier. Even without outlining before I can quite easily reach the word count. I think Basile hit the right spot with 200 words. It is not a huge commitment of time. At the same time, it still spurs you to write daily, which is key to build a habit and improve your writing.

If the numbers of words would be more at this stage, after more than a week, it would start to feel like a burden to keep up if you have any time of commitment. Especially since to write 500/700 words I need at least 30 to 45 minutes.

Lost Notes

Thanks to 200wordsaday I have found a lot of my old notes with writing topics and ideas and put them to use. No longer will they be forgotten files on my hard disk collecting digital dust.

Community

The community is also great. There are people writing about Tech. People writing journals. People writing about different topics every day. And so much more. It is very varied.

Conclusion

The future looks really bright for 200wordsaday as a great community to support each other while growing all together as writers.
