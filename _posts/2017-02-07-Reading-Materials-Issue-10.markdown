>Lexer: takes source code as an input and translates it into a stream of tokens;
Parser: takes stream of tokens as an input and translates it into an AST;
Semantic Analysis: takes an AST as an input, checks if a program is correct (method called with correct amount of parameters, method called on object actually exists and non-private, etc.), fills in ‘missing types’ (e.g.: let x = y, x has type of y) and passes AST to the next phase;
Code Generation: takes an AST as an input and emits some high level IR (intermediate representation);
Optimization: takes IR, makes optimizations and emits IR which is potentially faster and/or smaller;
AsmPrinter: another code generation phase, it takes IR and emits assembly for particular CPU;
Assembler: takes assembly and converts it into an object code (stream of 0s and 1s);
Linker: usually programs refer to already compiled routines from other programs (e.g.: printf) to avoid recompilation of the same code over and over. Until this phase these links do not have correct addresses, they’re just placeholders. Linker’s job is to resolve those placeholders, so that they point to the correct addresses of their corresponding routines.
