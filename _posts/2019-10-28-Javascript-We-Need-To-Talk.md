Javascript is everywhere and its popularity is only increasing with time. Soon enough everything will be able to run javascript, if we're not there already. Thanks to that advantage and the fact that you must[^1] write javascript to target the web most software is javascript and if you're a programmer it is a given that you will write some javascript sooner or later in your career.

Being used to really strong typing and compiler checks with Swift. I don't like writing Javascript. I try to avoid it as much as possible. I feel like it is really easy to write terrible and unsafe code with it. That said I still use it pretty often and slowly it is getting more bearable (mostly thanks to [Typescript][2]).

I love the ecosystem though, the idea of having so many people working together to build the standard library from scratch since Javascript does not ship with a standard library is something unique and empowering. It is also [terrifying][1], but that's a story for another day.

Whatever side of the argument you are, you love JS, you hate it, or like me are in the middle you are going to enjoy this video [50 min long, starts at 7:00]:

But that's obviously not limited to JS, this is something similar in Ruby[^2]:

[^1]: Nowadays you can use a language that gets compiled down to Javascript, but in the end the browser is running it. This changes with Web Assembly, but this is only a recent development and not ubiquitous yet.
[^2]: The language of choice for the scripting community on mac OS.
