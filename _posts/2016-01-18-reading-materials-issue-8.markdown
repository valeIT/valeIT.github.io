[Your Android unlock pattern sucks as much as your password did][1]

> 77% of patterns start in one of the corners; 44% start in the top left corner; they average five nodes (many have four!); they generally move left-right/top-bottom. Young men pick the strongest patterns; left-handers have the same start-points as righties. Oh, and a lot of people just swipe a Roman alphabet letter.

> Your sites are going under attack unless you pay 40 Bitcoin.

> Pay to \[\*\*\*\]
> 
> Please note that it will not be easy to mitigate our attack, because our current UDP flood power is 400--500 Gbps, so don't even bother. Or at least not with cheap protection like CloudFlare or Incapsula. But OK, you can try.

> Right now we are running small demonstrative attack on one of your IPs.

> Don't worry, it will not be hard and will stop in 1 hour. It's just to prove that we are serious.
> 
> We are aware that you probably don't have 40 BTC at the moment, so we are giving you 24 hours to get it and pay us.
> 
> You can pay directly through exchanger to our BTC address, you don't even need to have BTC wallet.
> 
> Current price of 1 BTC is about 230 USD, so we are cheap, at the moment. But if you ignore us, price will increase.
> 
> IMPORTANT: You don't even have to reply. Just pay 40 BTC to the identifier provided - we will know it's you and you will never hear from us again.
> 
> We say it because for big companies it's usually the problem as they don't want that there is proof that they cooperated. If you need to contact us, feel free to use some free email service. Or contact us via Bitmessage: \[\*\*\*}
> 
> But if you ignore us, and don't pay within 24 hours, long term attack will start, price to stop will go to 100 BTC and will keep increasing for every hour of attack.

> IMPORTANT: It's a one-time payment. Pay and you will not hear from us ever again!

> "Basically, we activate Prolexic by routing our traffic through Akamai's networks. They use BGP, or Border Gateway Protocol, to distribute our incoming data and check for signs of DDoS attacks. It's pretty easy for them to tell which constitutes good traffic and which are just bogus packets, so they shut down the data streams from the illegitimate sources and allow only the valid data to reach our own networks. It's a temporary measure only, since we don't need them to scrub our traffic unless there's an active issue," Jeremy explained.
> 
> Akamai offers a DDoS Hotline for Emergency DDOoS Protection to get those shields up fast. Akamai claims they have "2.8 Tbps of DDoS protection capacity" and they block "40--50 DDoS attacks every week." Jeremy's company activated the service before the threatened deadline, then monitored their incoming network traffic to see if anything unusual occurred.

> 
> When did you start hacking them? Years ago?  
> A long time ago. \[Note: in a README file in the first data dump, the hackers wrote that they had been collecting information from the company "over the past few years."\]
> 
> Will The Impact Team be hacking any other sites in the future? If so, what targets or sort of targets do you have in mind?  
> Not just sites. Any companies that make 100s of millions profiting off pain of others, secrets, and lies. Maybe corrupt politicians. If we do, it will be a long time, but it will be total.

Same goes for calls --- we don't make phonecalls. We sync-up, touch-base, or simply, connect.

> Estonian ID cards use open source public key-private key encryption (upgraded in 2011 to 2048-bit RSA), which allows government agencies to perform various secure functions online connected with a citizen's identity.  
> \[...\]  
> As a regular PGP user, I recognized the value of signing and encrypting documents sent back and forth. In basic terms, the process ensures documents aren't tampered with and confirms they originated from the right person.  
> We digitally signed both documents, cryptographically proving that they originated from us. But the part that I didn't realize until another Estonian pointed it out on Twitter was that this simple action had the full force of Estonian law behind it.

[The end of walking][31]

> In Orwellian fashion, Americans have been stripped of the right to walk, challenging their humanity, freedom and health
> 
> In 2011, Raquel Nelson was convicted of vehicular homicide following the death of her four-year-old son. Nelson, it's crucial to note, was not driving. She didn't even own a car. She and her three children were crossing a busy four-lane road from a bus stop to their apartment building in suburban Atlanta, Georgia. She'd stopped on the median halfway across when her son let go of her hand and stepped into the second half of the road. Nelson tried to catch him but wasn't fast enough; she and her two-year-old daughter were also injured.
> 
> The driver admitted to having alcohol and painkillers in his system (and to being legally blind in one eye) and pleaded guilty to the charge of hit-and-run. He served six months in prison. For the crime of walking three tired, hungry children home in the most efficient way possible, Nelson faced more jail time than the man who had killed her son.

All of this because she was jaywalking.

> As coconut oil is composed of a mixture of different fatty acids, it's highly unlikely that you would obtain a single crystal from it  
> \[...\]  
> So we have a different process directing the structure here. It should be noted that hexagonal packing in 2D is the most efficient, hence it tends to be a natural default. But first let's look at why it's not just a continuous solid...  
> \[...\]  
> The result of this process of cooling, contraction, and joint formation can actually be observed in nature in the form of columnar basalt (also referred to as "columnar jointing" of basalt). Examples such as Giant's Causeway in Ireland or Devil's Tower in Wyoming. You can read up a bit about columnar basalt in this post by the American Geophysical Union, or this good roundup from 2010 in Wired. Given the connection to columnar basalt, I think that we should actually get a specialist in geology to comment here...

[The Future of Developing Firefox Add-ons][36]

I agree with a few comments on the article:

> I'm somewhat skeptical, though, of making it impossible for users not running a "developer edition" to opt out, and accept less-reviewed addons. Not trusting users to make informed "opt-in" decisions is a bit insulting.
> 
> This is a big problem for govt contractors. We cannot legally release our addons to a third party, and Mozilla isn't on our list of approved hosts (unlike Google).
