[Best of Reddit - Introduction:][0]

> There are so many great threads on reddit, every single day, but soon they disappear into the void - for the very nature of reddit itself. This is a place to save what I find most "useful" in a given week.
> 
> I'd bet that the quality of this panel is gonna vary a lot on a week by week basis, but I hope that overall it's gonna be worthwile --- you'll be the judge of that.

Happy Halloween everyone! I tried not to let it take over the top 10 so you'll just find one reference for it. If you want to look for more you can always go to [r/halloween][1]. Before knocking there though, get your costumes on.

1. [TIFU By being a LOTR Fan][2]
2. [Why the poor pay $4,150 for a $1,500 sofa][3] - This was just so damn sad. Always check interest rates before buying anything on installment payments. Always.
3. Writing Prompt - [Humanity long ago discovered all of reality is a simulation created by others. They are long gone. Memory in the system is running out, and reality is starting to fray. Time skips and stutters. You are a member of the team sent to augment the machine that is our world.][4]
4. [My boyfriend's father died 14 years ago and this is one of the few pics he has of him. I'm trying to find the location it was taken. It's a long shot, but reddit, please help!][5] - Another thread on the topic: The internet is great.
5. [MKVs in excel][6] - Creativity at its best.
6. [Thought I forgot about Halloween eh? Of course I didn't, here you go =)][7]
7. [TIFU got horny while at the hospital, went to the bathroom to relive myself forgeting i'm on close pulse survailance.][8]
8. [Loknak find strange place.][9]
9. [Suspect Shuffling at Worchester SCG Standard Finals][10] - Cheating discovered.
10. [Lesbian Love][11] - This GIF makes no sense at all.
