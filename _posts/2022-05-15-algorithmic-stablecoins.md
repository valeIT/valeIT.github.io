<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Luna/UST guaranteed 20% APY. It went to zero after UST depegged from the US dollar. USDD is another algorithmic stablecoin that works like Luna/UST while offering an even higher 59% APY (while having no/limited reserves). What do you think will happen? <a href="https://t.co/vV7QXHGMhE">https://t.co/vV7QXHGMhE</a></p>&mdash; Valentino Urbano (@valentinourbano) <a href="https://twitter.com/valentinourbano/status/1525524548673802241?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 14, 2022</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Those who do not learn from history are doomed to repeat it. <br>Average stock market returns over a long period 5/10 years is 10%/year, how do you think stablecoin projects can give a better ‘safe’ return in 1 year? The answer is: a lot of risk. Risk that they don’t tell you about.</p>&mdash; Valentino Urbano (@valentinourbano) <a href="https://twitter.com/valentinourbano/status/1525524550695505921?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 14, 2022</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">DYOR before putting money into anything. Am I saying to never put money into risky assets? No,but if you do,you need to be aware of the risk and accept the high risk of losing it all. My suggestion is to prefer slow and steady,compounding growth,rather than gambling on moonshots.</p>&mdash; Valentino Urbano (@valentinourbano) <a href="https://twitter.com/valentinourbano/status/1525524552184434690?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 14, 2022</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I’m not saying that it will definitely crash, there is a (very) small chance it may not, but the risk is definitely there, especially now that the weakness inherent in algorithmic non-backed stablecoins is known.</p>&mdash; Valentino Urbano (@valentinourbano) <a href="https://twitter.com/valentinourbano/status/1525524553815969792?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 14, 2022</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

This is nothing new, there is something similar in the stock market called [debt spiral financing][2]
