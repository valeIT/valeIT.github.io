[Cisco has predicted that yearly internet usage will ramp up to 1.3 trillion gigabytes in 2016\. That's huge.][0]

Also the hosts _- where places to host a site -_ have ramped up from 213 in 1981 to the outstanding number of 888,239,000 last year \[1\]. And it will keep this momentum also for the years to come.
