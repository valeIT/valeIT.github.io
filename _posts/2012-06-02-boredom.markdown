Steve Jobs:

> Boredom allows one to indulge in curiosity, he explained, and out of curiosity comes everything. All the \[technology\] stuff is wonderful, but having nothing to do can be wonderful, too.

Using the iPhone (or any other smartphone ) every day for the whole day is killing **boredom**, which **is important to reflect, to have intuitions which are the engine of the future**.

Are we slowing the future to kill boredom?
