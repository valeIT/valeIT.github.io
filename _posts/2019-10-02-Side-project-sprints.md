Most of my side projects are the result of quick sprints. Periods of deep, Focused work in a relative short amount of time.

That does not mean that I work on a given project only for a few weeks (although that's the case for [some of them][1]). It means that the core functionality is ready relatively quickly. The rest takes way more time.

When you're developing the core functionalities of your idea you are deeply invested it in and eager to see it confirmed so the development is quicker and more straightforward.

It's the bells and whistles around it that take up the majority of the time. But do you really need them?

The difference between releasing a work in progress beta and a fully functioning 1.0 might be months or years. There are two opposing school of thought on this: The indie side of ship stuff quickly and the perfectionist side of ship stuff when ready.

I usually tend to be a moderate and pick somewhere in between. The app should not be too early in the development cycle to be obvious to users it is not ready, but it should also not take a year (or multiple years) to ship.

The best way to do it is to limit the feature scope drastically. Sure, while working you will think about new features and you might add a few (you should add them to the backlog and consider if they really should be in the first release or not), but if you start with very few and focused features you can go a long way in shorting your initial development time.
