There are different school of thought on navigation headers both for mobile application and websites. None of them are inherently wrong.

Some people have it only on the main page, most people have it on every page as an easy link to go back to the home alongside the navigation bar. It usually consists of simply the logo of the company/website, but not necessarely. Usually on a website there is enough space to add navigation links next to it so you do not waste the space.

## Mobile Navigation

On mobile it's a different story. The space is limited and navigation is not done through menus, but through tabs (usually).

The now dreaded hamburger menu had tried to introduce the concept of navigation menu on mobile, but it is simply a tool that should not be used as your main tool for navigation.

There are cases where it is the only tool available (thinking about financial apps with lot of options), but even there you can have tabs with the most used options so you can access them quickly and a different navigation tool (could be an hamburger menu) to navigate through the rest.

## Header

Since there is no web like navigation bar there is a different take on where and if to show the logo.

- You can either have the same header in every page.

This way you lose the ability of showing the title of every page making it less obvious and clear the purpose of the page especially for new users, but you can show a consistent header everywhere. It is something to avoid in most apps.

You can have it only in the home screen

 and everywhere else you have the title of the page or you don't have it completely.
