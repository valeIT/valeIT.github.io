Jeffrey Inscho:

> Developers of the next Instagram: please give users the opportunity to directly support your service by paying for it! Please take our money! Please have a sustainable business plan, or better yet, a platform philosophy!
> 
> Some platforms are doing it and it's working. Look at Pinboard. Look at 500pixels. Look at Instapaper. All thriving with a paying user base. It's time for us, as empowered users of technology, to start following the money.

It's time for the users to understand that internet doesn't mean free. If you want a service you have to feel good about paying them a _proper_ amount of money.
