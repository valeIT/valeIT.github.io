I've been using duolingo on and off for a couple of years. My wife is Polish and I'd really like to learn the language. It is damn hard though since its root (slavic) is not something I have any familiarity with and on top of that, they have a really difficult grammar with 7+ declinations for every single word.

In the last 2 months, I've tried keeping a streak there too. When they introduced Polish as a language 2 years ago I started right away, but broke the streak and stopped. The worse was that the streak broke because of a problem with Duolingo. I did my lesson for the day, but it did not register. At the time I wasn't really certain I did it so I assumed I did not, but now it happened again. Fortunately, since that day, I learned to always have a steak freeze equipped so I didn't lose my current streak, but it's still annoying.

Yesterday I completed my lesson as usual and today I find out that I no longer have a streak freeze and duolingo is telling me that I did not complete my lesson yesterday, even though I did. I also asked my wife if I was going crazy, but she confirmed that I asked her questions about certain sentences so she was certain I did it.
