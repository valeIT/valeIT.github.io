At work we use Slack for everything. As I guess most companies nowadays.

The secret in effectively using Slack is knowing what it is for and what it is not.

- Chat

It is a chat and not documentation. If you know that you will need something from Slack at a later date extract it in a Google Docs for later and put the link in slack instead

- Groups

Groups are great. When you have a discussion about something that relates to the whole project or part of it which is more than 1 person create a group for it and try to avoid using direct messages so other people can take advantage of whats talked about and can keep up to date without having to always ask and you answer the same questions,

- Rich Content

It is really ease to embed any kind of rich content in slack. Make use of it.

- Bots

Take advantage of the bot support and big bot libraries. A few examples:
1. Ping on slack when a new version or beta is released
1. Ping on slack when the tests pass/fail
1. Ping when a new Pull Request is open
1. Ping when a new Pull Request is merged

- Calendar

It integrates well with a calendar to let other people know if you're in a meeting or not.
