Merry Christmas

I'm taking a break for Christmas. I'm going to write more personal topics in the next few days that take less time to plan and write.

In typical Italian fashion we ate with relatives on Christmas Eve, on Christmas and we are also going out tomorrow. Follows a small break to digest and on the 31st we're all back up at it again for the new year's celebrations.

On a great turn of events, I have also got a fever (temperatures keep shifting wildly lately) so I almost missed the deadline today, but not quite.

Christmas is one of the few days of the year when you can join in with all your family and have a nice time together. A time when problems and distractions are out of our minds, even if it's just for one day or a few hours. Never disappearing, but maybe a little less present than on a usual day.

Since my wife is Polish (and her family is back in Poland) it is harder, we have to visit each family once every 2 years for Christmas. Many people would just decide to always celebrate in the country they're currently living, but I don't believe that's always the correct choice.

Spend this time with your family and your loved ones. Merry Wintersday everyone.
