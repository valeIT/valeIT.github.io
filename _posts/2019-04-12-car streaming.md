# Car streaming

I had a crazy idea. Is there a way to stream an international car journey? Next week I'm going to Poland (to my wife's family) for a week on a 1200km journey. It is pretty tiring so I only do it once a year. It is mostly uneventful, but I haven't seen it streamed before. The main problems are 2 battery life (and heat) and data charges. I'm going to be crossing multiple EU contries, even thought thanks to the European Commission we have free roaming in the EU it is capped by the carrier to the least amount of data they can give you so you can't stream it without paying hundreds if not thousands in overcharge fees. On top of that there is no battery that is going to withstand the 15 hours of video streaming and even if I used external batteries the heat produced by streaming continuosly for such a long amount of time in a car would be problematic. I can put the device next to the AC unit for a while, but it would cut the stream and it would be less than ideal. Because of all of that I dn't think I'll actually manage to stream this time, but maybe I'll get some suggestions on how to do it for the next time around.

Anyone has an idea if there is a possible way or if anyone has done something like that before?
