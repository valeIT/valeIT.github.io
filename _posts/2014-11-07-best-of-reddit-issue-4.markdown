[Best of Reddit - Introduction:][0]

> There are so many great threads on reddit, every single day, but soon they disappear into the void - for the very nature of reddit itself. This is a place to save what I find most "useful" in a given week.
> 
> I'd bet that the quality of this panel is gonna vary a lot on a week by week basis, but I hope that overall it's gonna be worthwile --- you'll be the judge of that.

Starting from next week I will change the layout of this panel and add more personal comments.
