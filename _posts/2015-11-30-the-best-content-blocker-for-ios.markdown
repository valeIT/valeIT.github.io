People have been wondering which is the best Content Blocker for iOS since iOS9 came out supporting Content Blockers. 1Blocker is definitely the best one (the paid version) available on the App Store right now. But I went beyond that.

If you're not interested in fancy animations and just want the quickest loading times without any ad crap or tracking just disable javascript everywhere, it's that easy.

Settings -\> Safari -\> Advanced -\> JavaScript -\> Off.

And disable any content block since their job is done already for you.

You're welcome.

NOTE: Of course this is an extreme solution and you will surely lose some rich content while doing so, but I feel like the compromise (on iOS) is acceptable. Of course I'd never do that on a Mac and I use a content blocker there (uBlock for Ads + Ghostery for Trackers).
