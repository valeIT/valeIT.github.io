I've promised to write about geoblocking as well. Here we go.


You go to the usual place, logging in with the same account you've been using for years, ready to listen to the music that you love:

YouTube music isn't available in your country. Use the official YouTube app instead.

Owning your music is so 2000s. With streaming being the norm nowadays come its set of problems. Not to talk about stores shutting down and such, if you're interested in it I've written another article just on that topic. Moving between countries brings up all sorts of unnecessary hassles. If I'm an Italian citizen and I'm on holiday in a different country why would you geo-block me from accessing content I can access in Italy? I can understand it if I would be in China behind the great firewall, but I'm not. I'm not even outside the European Union!

All of this on top of the fact that YouTube music is not really a streaming platform, it just YouTube with a different UI and an optional subscription. So why block it? The most hilarious part of it all is that if I just use the YouTube app to access the exact same content it will work just fine (obviously, but it is worth pointing out given the ridiculousness of it all). So it is pretty obvious that the geo-block is not for some superior/legitimate reason, but just plain corporate policy by Google (I might be wrong on this, but that's the obvious outcome I see from the data I have).

You should not blame only Google here though. This habit is widespread across the whole industry and it keeps getting worse as more and more services move to proprietary platforms and subscriptions only.
