Can't believe I missed it.

It was August, 26th.

This blog was actually created a few days before that, but [the first post was published on that day][0].

This post will be a natural follow up of the [First Month article][1], as it should be.

## Thing I Learned

There are so many things i learn thanks to the post i write and the blogs i follow, but the most important thing is that i can be fine without the internet. In July I spent 10 days without the internet and [i wrote an article about that, not yet published][2].

For other things jump at the "Best Posts" section.

## Changes

As i started writing this article i dropped support for readability through this site. Don't scare off, i'm not blocking it, i'm just deleting the "read now / read later" buttons. I'm sure if you need them you will have installed on your browser. Those button were just slowing the site down and distracting from the reading.

## Best Posts (only full lenght posts)

These are the ones i think are the best through these 6 months, many more to come soon.
