## Walking

Walking is a choice.

I have an office job and if I wanted to I could just sit all day in my chair without moving at all (assuming I do not have meetings that day). For some time I spent the time at my job like that, as I expect most people do as well.

Starting last year I decided to take a glass of (still) water and put it on my desk. A small glass. Every single day.

Each time I take a pause I see the glass and take a sip. When the water is finished I walk to the water dispenser furthest away from my desk to refill it. The office is not huge so I do not waste more than a minute doing it, but I also walk a bit. I do this on average 5 times a day. An added bonus is that I also rest my eyes from the screen for this short time[^1].

On top of that I try to spend at least one hour on the [treadmill][1] every day I'm in the office, but I realize that most offices do not have it so that's not usually an option.
