Having the need of splitting files is something that comes up less and less often to everyone's joy. Unfortunately it still happens to me to have to deal with legacy systems were FAT is the norm at least once a year.

The main problem is with FAT partitions that will support only up to 4GB. Most HHD and OSes are now using something better than FAT that supports big files.

From the command line you can do it in one line:
`zip existing.zip --out new.zip -s 50m`

This command will create multiple zip files up to 50mb. Double click on the first file in the archive to unzip it.

[A different solution from superusers][1]:

>1. To create a split zip archive (a series of files named zip, z01, z02...), run following command in Terminal:
>
>zip -s 100m -x "\*.DS_Store" -r split-foo.zip foo/
>
>2. To extract a split zip archive (a series of files named zip, z01, z02...), run following command in Terminal:

>First, combine the split archive to a single archive:
>
>zip -s 0 split-foo.zip --out unsplit-foo.zip


>Extract the single archive using unzip:
>unzip unsplit-foo.zip
>if you have splitted binaries, like file.zip.001, file.zip.002 ... you may just need to combine the files e.g. using cat command: cat file.zip.\* > single.zip â€“ abimelex Apr 29 '15 at 9:52

If you prefer an application instead of doing it from the Terminal try ['keka'][2].
