And second Issue of "Reading Material for the Week", the new installment of "Best of Reddit". It will still include links from reddit, but it will also include links for the whole web. It'll mostly be focused on programming and technology, but it'll vary.

> Disclaimer: These were all the links in my read later for this week. It doesn't mean that I agree or approve any of the content. The longest ones will be included in _hr_ to keep them separated from the rest of the content.
> 

Notice: Some of the links may be either explicit or may disturb someone. It will be obious from the title if that's the case or not (99% of the times it won't). Proceed at your own risk.

From [Christoph Anton Mitterer][7]:

> Since no one really know which binaries have been downloaded there and  
> what they actually do, and since it cannot be excluded that it was  
> actually executed, such systems are basically to be considered  
> compromised.
> 
> Quite a deal of people choose open source just to prevent that - get  
> untrustworthy / unverifiable code run on their systems - failed.
> 
> And to be quite honest, I seriously consider the good faith of an such  
> upstream which does these kinds of things and wonder whether it can be  
> considered trustworthy enough to be part of Debian or whether it should  
> be banned from it.  
> More or less silently bundling proprietary code with open source  
> software (especially but not only when enabled per default) can already  
> be considered quite bad behaviour.
> 
> But basically secretly downloading it leads to the question of possible  
> malicious intent (and everyone knows that Google&Co. do voluntarily  
> and/or forcibly cooperate with NSA and friends).  
> And I guess no one can prove that this blob didn't contain any rootkit,  
> and even if - the rootkit'ed version may have been just distributed to  
> certain people.  
> The downloading makes it more or less impossible for the admin/user and  
> especially for our maintainers to notice what's happening here  
> (otherwise they'd need audit every line of code for any such  
> occasions).
