In Poland they have this custom of having 'gardens'. They are little areas of the city, usually located in the suburbs, where people have a small plot of land with a garden. Most people build tiny houses on it, not to be used as primary home (they're really small), but to be used in the weekends for families get-together, relaxation or grilling opportunities.

I find the idea to be great. You can get there really quickly from the city and stay there the whole weekend. I'm not sure if you're allowed to sleep in the premises, but even if you don't it doesn't take long to reach and you can spend 2 full days a week in the garden if you so wish. Obviously it is something you mostly use in the summer, but having a house with heating you can also go there during fall/early winter if you so wish.

It is interesting to see all the different style of houses. There are people who really care about the flowers and the garden and others that focus more on the house itself. They're usually very varied. I also love the fact that they're gated communities, no cars allowed. There is usual truck of repairmen and the link, but apart from those necessities the small roads are free for walking and cycling.
