Welcome to this new column "The Best Of Reddit" --- 'column' LOL yes, we're professionals here. It's gonna be a(n almost) weekly post with the best posts on reddit. In the beginning it will be limited to a few subreddits, but as time goes on I'm planning to include r/all as well. I'm not doing that now cause it's a huge commitment of time to go through r/all and pick the best post every day.

There are so many great threads on reddit, every single day, but soon they disappear into the void - for the very nature of reddit itself. This is a place to save what I find most "useful" in a given week.

I'd bet that the quality of this panel is gonna vary a lot on a week by week basis, but I hope that overall it's gonna be worthwile --- you'll be the judge of that.

• [TIFU by admitting to my girlfriend that I pretend she is a giant cockroach when we have sex.][0]

Even available in an awesome, aka disgusting [narration][1]. Oh Ogtha...

• [A billionaire agrees to fund the best idea on this thread that will have a positive impact on people or the environment. What is your great idea to change the world? ][2]

Probably the best idea is [this one:][3]

> It's like Tinder but for people who want to fight.
> 

I'm pretty sure venture firms will drop big money on it. If you don't believe me just remember that [they funded an app that just says YO for 1.5 Million $][4].

• Writing Prompt: [As you've slept, the teddy bear you adore has fought off demons to keep you safe. The night before you decide you're going to get rid of him, seeing as how you've outgrown him, you awake to witness his last stand against the forces that intend to forever corrupt your childhood innocence.][5]

• [Reddit community amasses 50+ people on Teamspeak and talk a teen out of suicide, saving his life.][6]

This is great, take a second to notice the outcasts and the bullied and simply say "hi". It might not seems as much to you, but it could make a difference. As for everybody suffering, drop me an email if you want to talk anytime ;)

• [Motivational Wallpapers][7]

Myshar.org, encouraging people to stop slacking everyday. _Not really..._

• [ELI5:What the Architect in the Matrix Reloaded movie was saying to Neo.][8]

I loved the Matrix trilogy and the idea behind it. I'm still stuck on the thought that it could be reality and we wouldn't even know that. Oh well time to play and cheer myself back up.

• [Reddit CEO calls out former Reddit employee as to why he was fired.][9]

Another reason why internet is awesome.

• [MFWTK how he can join ISIS][10]

• [An insight description to what happens when you have Diabetes][11]

• [Making of Return of the Jedy - 50 Pics][12]

If you're fan of Star Wars, make sure to [follow Chewbacca on twitter][13], he usually tweets nice stuff like that on a regular basis.
