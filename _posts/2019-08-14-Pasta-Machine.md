We brought a pasta machine from Italy. Not one to cook it in a fancy way, one to actually make it.

Here's how it works (not a recipe, just a very general outline to get the idea):
You first make the dough as you would for anything, with a lot of eggs and after it gets to the right consistency you put it in the machine that makes it of the correct width. Finally you pass it in the machine again on another end to cut it in smaller or bigger pieces depending if you want pappardelle or tagliatelle.

As the parting gift to my home country my wife decided to make homemade tagliatelle to share with our family for dinner.
Homemade fresh pasta taste so much better than bought one. If you've never tried it you have no idea what you're missing out on. The machine was quite expensive, luckily we found it on offer for 40 EUR, but it regularly goes for 80. It allows you to make different kind of egg based long pasta from tagliatelle to pappardelle and even lasagne.
We haven't tried it for lasagne yet, but we well someday. The only advice I want to share is to make sure to have decent toppings, I would suggest ragu since meat goes great on it. If the sauce doesn't have enough taste you're only going to feel the pasta, which doesn't have much taste per se.

In a world full of processed food everywhere it is nice to eat something genuine from time to time. The big limit is time, even though it was the first time so there was a lot of time wasted to learn how to use the machine we took 3 hours in total.
