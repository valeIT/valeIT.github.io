A quick post to thank everyone for this first month together.

My main target in writing this site is not to gain pageviews or visitor, I don't mind.  My main target, as I've already said much time - but maybe it's worth saying another time more, is learning. Writing is a great way to learn new things, to delve new unexplored topics.

I learned more this month writing that the past 3 months reading articles, really.

As an example, this month I learned [^1]:

* the existence of NetApplications;
* a (not so) great quote by  Michael Dell;
* that so many (relevant) blogs have turned comments off;
* that a big American newspaper doesn't care to give proper credits to the ones who really break the news first;
* therestartpage.com =);
* how bad is the Android fragmentation (really worst than I expected) ;
* that I can't  use only an iPad to write, not yet;
* that the official WordPress app for both iOs and android sucks;
* I recalled few episodes of my online life that I'd almost forgotten.

Not bad for just a month.

Thanks to everyone: the ones who gave only a look, the ones who support what I do here and the ones who disapprove it, because only with someone who let you know your mistakes we get better, it's the only way to improve.
