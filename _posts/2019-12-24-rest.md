The Christmas holidays are one of the few periods of the year when you can really rest for a while if you decide to do so.[^1]

As indies we're always looking for time to dedicate to our side projects and it often conflicts with family time. Unfortunately there are only so few hours in a day.

This year I will not work on any side project until the end of the year and instead just enjoy the time with my family.

It would be nice if I could go back to Italy to see the rest of my family as well, but it was not possible this year.

[^1]: That is if you don't need to cook the Christmas dinner yourself and even worse if you have guests.
