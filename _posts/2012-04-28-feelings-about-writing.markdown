[Jeff Atwood][0]:

> For example, I don't care if anyone reads what I write here. I'm writing to satisfy myself first and foremost. If others read it and benefit from it, fantastic --- that's a welcome side effect. If I worry about _who_ is reading, _why_ they're reading, or if_anyone_ is even reading at all, I'd be too paralyzed to write! That'd be the least productive outcome of all.

These are exactly the same feeling i have about writing something on this blog, i do it for myself as i stated both in my [colophon][1] and in my[first month][2] post.  
It's also a way to improve both my knowledge and my writing skills. You an only improve through practice.
