I would rather have a thicker device than keep this awful battery life. Even with light use my mac cannot last more than 3-4 hours. Often times I find myself having to interrupt my workflow to go back to a power outlet. Sometimes this is not possible so I have to stop what I'm doing until I get back to a charger. The situation on an iPhone is slightly better since they're actively trying to increase battery life year over year and I don't really use it too much so I never found myself in need of charging it during the day.

The situation worsens if I'm actually working on it since while developing you rarely exceed the 2 hours of screen on time. Often I'm forced to bring the charger whenever I go since I just know that the mac battery won't last enough for the working session.

Unfortunately Apple seems still stuck with the mentality on mac that thinner is better and does not care about increasing the battery life too much. As time goes on we see improvements in most other areas, but the energy side seems to be left aside without any consideration.
