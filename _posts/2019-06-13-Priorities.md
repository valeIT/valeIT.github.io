You should be able to name off the top of your head your top x priority at any given moment.

I'm not talking about what's important right here and now, I'm talking about [long term goals][0].

We get so lost up in the moment, in our routine or in the project we're building right now that we lose sight of what we're really trying to accomplish in life.

I'm a big believer that if you wake up unhappy every single day, a change needs to happen, but few people seem to be aware or talk about it.

They just cruise happily through life without reflecting on the bigger picture and when they do it is too late to make the necessary changes.

Don't misunderstand, having a routine is totally fine. What is needed is taking one day, let's say every 6 months[^1] when you ask yourself: Is what I've been doing in the past 6 months leading me towards the future I want for myself (and my family)?

And if the answer is nope too many times in a row, you know something needs to change.

Priorities can change. You can change. Always be ready to adapt.

[^1]: If 6 doesn't work for you do what you feel it's best. I think 6 is the right compromise without doing it too often or doing it too little. This period might expand with time. I'm still in my 20s so every year a lot of things change. This might not be true in my 40s - or it might still be - I don't know yet. That's why it's a personal value and shouldn't be a static period of time.
