# Standing Desk

We have a standing desk at the office. It is usually very lonely. I can count on two hands the number of times people apart from me and a coworker have used it in the last 3 months. I can also count on one hand the number of people who have used it and we have 40+ people in the office.

Sitting for 8 hours a day, every day, is really bad for your health. It is usually even more than that since most people (me included) sit a lot when they get home as well.

It used to be something that most people didn't hear about, but now everybody knows it. The difference is you can choose to act on that knowledge or not.

The first step is to get up and take a stroll every once in a while. In doesn't need to be long, just a few minutes will do it. You will still be sitting most of the times, but it is going to be better than sitting **all the times**. I'm the furthest away from the water dispenser so I have a good excuse to get up and walk every few hours.

I'm now trying to use the standing desk at least 2 hours every other day. It is not a lot, but it is a good start.

Just try one with no commitment. In the beginning I thought that I would be less productive, but it is not true at all. You just need to get used to it.
