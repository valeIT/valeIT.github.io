The problem with Bing it's not in their [user interface][0] (evidently copied by Google search),but in their results. If they want to beat Google on its own ground then you don't need just to provide a slightly better results, you have to provide **way better** search results.

Duckduckgo is trying to do that with their !bang feature and their 'top box' above the actual results, we'll see if Microsoft has a surprise for us either - which I doubt.

_Update:_ It seems that I was wrong! Bing has announced a partnership with twitter and facebook to show their social results in searches.

A recap on the social features:

* Google offers Google+
* Bing offers everything but Google+.

Hard choice.
