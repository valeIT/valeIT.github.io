We absorb more information in a day that some people ages ago did in their whole life and the rate is just accelerating. Is there a physical limit that the human brain will stop cause it's too much at once will we ever reach it?

Curation is more important than ever and it will keep increasing in importance in the future. The rate of new videos uploaded to youtube, new games on steam and new songs on soundcloud and new articles on the web is skyrocketing. Without curation, we are going to just get lost in this ocean of content.

The most popular way of solving the problem is via an algorithm, it's always active, tailored to you and it doesn't cost nearly as much as a person (or multiple people) doing the same job.

I would rather have a human curating it and maybe pay for it instead of being free, but by an algorithm. We've already seen what we are going to get with it from Facebook, Youtube, Twitter and more.

I predict that the need for Honest Human Curated Content is going to keep increasing with time.

We all need to be aware and start to vote with our attention.  You can start by deleting your Facebook account, for example. [I've done it 5 years ago.][1]
