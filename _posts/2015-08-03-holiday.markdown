I've spent the last half of 2014 and all of 2015 [developing apps][0], now that finally 90% of the apps that I planned to ship this summer are actually live in the store and I've shipped the first wave of updates out to fix the first bugs in 1.0s I'm taking a break.

It won't be a long break, but nonetheless... I'll be turning off Xcode on Wednesday and it will stay shut for a full week.
