If you read only one review of the new OSX Mountain Lion make sure it's [this one][0] by John Siracusa. [24 pages]

**Edit**:Federico [Viticci and his team at Macstories have written a great 120 pages ebook][1] on the new OS, make sure to check it out too. Part of the revenuew will be devoted to the American Cancer Society.
