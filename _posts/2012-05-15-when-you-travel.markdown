> **3\. Steal soap from your hotel and give it to kids in developing countries as a present**. Studies have shown that distributing soap to kids in poor countries saves lives. Travelers are always thinking up things to give to kids that ask for handouts (pencils, erasers, candies) but nothing beats the gift of clean hands. And don't just collect 1 or 2 from your hotel bathroom. Hit the hallways while the cleaning staff are having a smoke and grab a couple handfuls from the service carts. When you're saving lives, Go Big.

It does cost you nothing. Do this, everytime it's possile.
