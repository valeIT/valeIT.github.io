[Ben brooks][0] make a collection of the quotes of the main topic all across the blogosphere yesterday: Mike Daisey statement about the work conditions in China at foxconn were lies.

  
[Marketplace][1] Talked with cathie Lee (the translator which was with daisey in China - he didn't speak Chinese):

> Cathy Lee, Daisey's translator in Shenzhen, was with Daisey at this meeting in Shenzhen. I met her in the exact place she took Daisey---the gates of Foxconn. So I asked her: "Did you meet people who fit this description?"
> 
> "No," she said.
> 
> "So there was nobody who said they were poisoned by hexane?" I continued.
> 
> Lee's answer was the same: "No. Nobody mentioned the Hexane."
> 
> I pressed Cathy to confirm other key details that Daisey reported. Did the guards have guns when you came here with Mike Daisey? With each question I got the same answer from Lee. "No," or "This is not true."

Then they met Daisey:

> Rob Schmitz: Cathy says you did not talk to workers who were poisoned with hexane.
> 
> Mike Daisey: That's correct.
> 
> RS: So you lied about that? That wasn't what you saw?
> 
> MD: I wouldn't express it that way.
> 
> RS: How would you express it?
> 
> MD: I would say that I wanted to tell a story that captured the totality of my trip.
> 
> Ira Glass: Did you meet workers like that? Or did you just read about the issue?
> 
> MD: I met workers in, um, Hong Kong, going to Apple protests who had not been poisoned by hexane but had known people who had been, and it was a constant conversation among those workers.
> 
> IG: So you didn't meet an actual worker who'd been poisoned by hexane.
> 
> MD: That's correct.

As I said [few weeks ago][2] Most journalist have sold their souls to pageviews when they should care about users and great content.
