Limited Time On Twitter

Last month, as part of my end of the year, push to avoid information overload I dropped of Twitter and used it very sparingly. I haven't tweeted much and I haven't read too much of what was going on in the platform. I feel like I haven't missed too much and surely not things of vital importance. I'm still connected to the various groups using slack or telegram (whenever I feel like checking them - I absolutely do not have push notifications on for either of the apps) and if someone needs to get hold of me for something important they surely have my phone number so they can call/WhatsApp. If they don't they can email me.

I've done something more drastic in 2015/2016 when I spent one year off Twitter entirely. From that experience, I learned that I didn't need Twitter. Before that time I was using it constantly, way too often and I was losing a lot of time just mindlessly checking my infinite timeline. At that time I was following way too many people, all of which had interesting things to say, but it was way too much information coming in for the time I had.

Everything in moderation.
