Writing something every day does not mean to write an article that could be published in x magazine every day (insert Forbes, times,... instead of x). It just means to write something, anything. Put the words on the page.

There will be days when you are more "in the zone" and days when you are less and you don't feel like writing at all. It is normal when you do something consistently for a long time. That doesn't mean that you can't do it for that day, it just means that you will struggle more and it is possible that what comes out is not the best, but it doesn't matter. What matters is that you showed up and you can be sure that the next day will be better.

There will also be days when you can dedicate an hour to writing and days when if you manage you get 15 uninterrupted minutes to write it is going to feel like an accomplishment.

Don't be scared that your writing will suck, it most certainly will (at times), but so does everybody else. If you put up an article a month you will feel like it needs to be perfect and you might never overcome that first barrier of putting yourself out there. But doing it in small doses over a longer period of time won't make you expect the same level of perfection of yourself that is going to stop you. That doesn't mean that it will be easy or straightforward, but it might be easier for someone who struggles with it.
