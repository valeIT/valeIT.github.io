[Great post by matt gemmel outlining the pros and cons of releasing an app on MAS vs releasing it directly.][0]

Non power users are gonna buy almost only Mac App Store apps, expecially those who possess an iOs device. They're just too much used to it and it doesn't need to insert weird codes or download app which starts a pop up as opened the first time\[1\].

1.On OS X you have to confirm before opening an app downloaded from the browser.
