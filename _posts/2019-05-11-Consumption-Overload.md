_Some thoughts I stumbled upon writing the next entry in the [Information][1] [Overload][2] series on trying to limit consumption with the goals of being more creative and taking a more active role during down time._

> Youtube is the second thing that grew in time spent procrastinating. Thankfully "Watch Later" saved me from the urge of watching everything in my timeline as soon as I saw a new video being available.

It has its downsides though. During busy periods I ended up having 200+ videos in the list. Something similar happened to my Instapaper/Pocket account back in the day where I would mark articles to read later just to have them pile up unread.

The only solution was to declare **Consumption Overload**:[^1]
Deleting every single entry without reading it.

Many people do this with emails when they find themselves with 10k+ emails in their inboxes.
It doesn't feel right, but when you reach that point you need to face the truth: There is no chance you are going to go through them all. It's better to start anew. This time hopefully having learned to press that save button a little less frequently.

[^1]: Yes I just made that up, but I feels it sums up the point perfectly.
