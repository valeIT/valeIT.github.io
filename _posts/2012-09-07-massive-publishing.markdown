In the last few months I started writing many articles that now lie in a folder into my dropbox account.

But most of them are outdated (not everyone), what am i gonna do with them?

You decide. Pick one of the following:

1. Publish them anyway 4 a day for a week.
2. Don't publish them: I'll keep in the non-published folder in dropbox
3. I've got another awesome idea.

Contact me and let me know.

It's not that I'm lazy, it's that without an editor I don't know when an article is ready. I keep editing it over and over again, yep after the productivity porn now i have invented the editing porn.

You're welcome to join the party every evening in my house.[^1]


[^1]: Joking, I usually prefer staying alone than being with people so feel free to stay where you are, unless you're an editor of course than send me an email ;)
