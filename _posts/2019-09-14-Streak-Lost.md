# Streak Lost

I lost my steak on both Duolingo and here. For duolingo I didn't get to practise either, the good part about my writing is that I could still write even while offline. As with most problems there is not once single factor or cause for it, it is always multiple factors working together to facilitate an outcome. I think it is pretty interesting...

1. I went to a remote lake
2. I expected internet to work there (duh, it's 2019) so I wasn't really worried about it
3. I realized it did not
4. After being pretty annoyed I became at peace with it.

You see I've been burned with losing a streak before on Duolingo. Due to a bug (very often you complete a lesson and it is marked as done on your screen, but if you refresh the page you realize it didn't really go through). Now I always reload the page to check it. But that make me quit duolingo for a year.

I've learned a lot from it. Mostly that a streak doesn't really mean that much[^1]. It is a great way to prove to yourself that you can do it, but not much more than that.

You could write every day before that. And you can do the same even after. No point in quitting.
