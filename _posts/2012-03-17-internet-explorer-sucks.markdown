Finally after many years Microsoft admitted that IE 6/7 sucks, in fact they're forcing all the users to update to the latest versions (IE 9/10).  
They made a great commercial about that.

You can see from a simple ad like this one that Microsoft is not boastful (like google), not at all.  
They're trying to reinvent themselves even if it means moving to unknown territory (with Windows 8 ) or making self-irony with ads like this [one][0].

I've also sent an email to them, i'll quote an extract:

> I really have to reconsider your brand. Try to push hard on bing and maybe in the future i might consider to switch from google to bing instead of duckduckgo.
