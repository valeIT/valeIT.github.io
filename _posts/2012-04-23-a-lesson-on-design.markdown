[Matt Gemmel:][0]

> Design an experience. Make it as beautiful -- and as emotionally resonant -- as it can possibly be. Then adorn the core experience and content with only as much functionality as is absolutely necessary. Functionality -- and software-based thinking in general -- is like seasoning. A little is an enhancement; any more destroys the flavour, subsumes the artistry of the chef, and may well be bad for you.

In a sentence: Make it as simple as possible.
