<!-- A different kind of users -->

I've always made websites and applications for people who knew how to use them. Not necessarely technical people, but people who would take the time to either search the app on the app store because they needed it for some task or people who would go on google and search for the website.

Recently I have been doing an enterprise application for employees who are not necessarely seeking the application themselves, but it is being 'forced' upon them by their CEO. Their behavior is way different, and even though it is a tool that will make their work easier it has been met with veiled (at times less veiled) resistance.

After explained the benefits and giving it time for them to try it out on their own terms it got better, but it is still nowhere near where it would be if they went out to look for the application instead of it being forced on them (not that it would have been possible). Changing people way of work, ingrained in them for decades, is a hard job, especially if you add on top of them the fact that most of them are not tech savvy users.
