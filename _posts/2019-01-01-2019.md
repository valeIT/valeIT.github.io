Happy new year everyone!

A new year comes with new challenges and goal. Don't make the mistake of only think about what you accomplished in 2018 and what you want to do in 2019 during these days though. If you want to keep track of where you're going and of [The Bigger Picture][0] you should regularly check if what you're doing on a day to day basis aligns with your goals.

If it does not for too many days in a row it might be time to change something. It might also not be a symptom of anything, but just a period when you're otherwise busy and that's nothing wrong with that. You need to have the ability to stop and analyze if you're in the former case of the latter though and not just let it go regardless.

## Looking back at 2018

Looking back at the previous year on [Twitter][1] I announced the goals for the last few months of 2018:

- Learn frontend development
  Accomplished. I'm still not 100% comfortable, but I can hold my own and develop and full web application.

- Learn android development
  Still in progress. I've taken the first few steps though. I'm using [Flutter][2] to try something new and loving it so far.

Did accomplish what you wanted in 2018? Do you already have a plan on what to do in 2019?
