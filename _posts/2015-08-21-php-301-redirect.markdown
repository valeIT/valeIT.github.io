I needed to do a 301 redirect, but didn't have access neither to the cpanel nor ftp. I could just edit the full html code of the index.php page from the built in editor in the browser.

**NOTICE**: For this to work it needs to be a .php page and your server needs to have php enabled and able to run of course :P

In the `head` section add (obviously between php opening and closing tags):

    
    header("HTTP/1.1 301 Moved Permanently"); 
    header("Location: http://www.valentinourbano.com");
