I needed to do a 301 redirect but I neither had access to the cPanel or FTP. I could just edit the full HTML code of the index.php page from the built-in editor in the browser.

**NOTICE**: It needs to be a .php page and your server needs to have PHP enabled and able to run of course ;)

In the `head` section add (obviously between PHP opening and closing tags):


```
header("HTTP/1.1 301 Moved Permanently");
header("Location: http://www.valentinourbano.com");
```
