Every company in the world works is a rollercoaster, mind that,  there are times when you go up, but some day this growt will end in a way or another, even for Apple. As in a rollercoaster the discent may be fast or slow, but sooner or later it has to happen.

Even the most successful company in the world can't grow forever, in the best case scenario it can grow til the Earth is fully saturated \[[1][0]\], then it have to stop because it doesn't have the necessary resources to keep growing _(unless we discover another civilization on another planet, but that's science fiction for now)_.

With that i'm not saying that Apple will fall, it will in the long period, like everybody else, but luckily these days are still many yearsdecades away.

I do trust that Apple stock will still [grow][1], big time.

1.Taking as an example the phone industry the iphone now is growing at a 100% ratio per year and it'll keep this path for a while, but when every users who now has a feature phone switchs to a smartphone you can't pretend that the ration won't suffer, maybe it'll grow anyway, but you can't pretend that it does at a 100% rateo per year.
