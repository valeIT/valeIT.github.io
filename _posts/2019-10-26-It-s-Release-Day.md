# It's Release Day

**Teria is now available for free on both the [iOS App Store][1] and the [Android Play Store][2].**

[From Fall App Updates][3]:
> Teria is a minimal note taking app that opens directly into the editor ready to type in. I use it to jolt down ideas all the time. On top of that it offers a calendar with streaks to see how much you've written each day.
>
You can learn more about it [here][4].

[Patch Notes are also available][6].
