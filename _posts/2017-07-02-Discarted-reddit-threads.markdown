<a href="http://www.myshar.org/best-of-reddit-introduction/">Best of Reddit - Introduction:</a>
<blockquote>There are so many great threads on reddit, every single day, but soon they disappear into the void - for the very nature of reddit itself. This is a place to save what I find most “useful” in a given week.

I’d bet that the quality of this panel is gonna vary a lot on a week by week basis, but I hope that overall it’s gonna be worthwile — you’ll be the judge of that.</blockquote>

Every week I leave out tens and tens of posts that are interesting, but clearly can't be included in the top 10 of the week. This is a collection of those threads for the months of October and November 2014. I'll probably gonna do this on a trimestrial basis both to have enough material and to have enough time to put it all together.

>I had two patients in a room together. One was an older woman in decent health. I can't remember what she was there for, but it wasn't anything super serious. The other patient was a black woman in her mid 20's who was mentally disabled. She talked all friggin day about the woman in the other bed. The woman in the other bed was awake and alert and getting really annoyed about it. Like 90% of it was "She dead. That woman dead". It was really creepy. We have no idea why she went on and on like that. They had been in there together for several days and that one day she started in. The woman told her several times she wasn't dead, but she just kept going on. The mentally disabled patient was discharged that day, talking all the way out about how her roomate was dead.
Her roomate died that night of a heart attack.
