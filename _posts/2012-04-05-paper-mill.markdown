The developer of papermill, the first Instapaper app for Android has written an analysis of his first week on the android market.
The app is priced at 3.99â‚¬ and it requires an Instapaper subscription to work.

It has been installed on 411 devices.

> approximately $590 in profit thus far.

After a week, the launch week.

**Update (October 9, 2014):** Papermill has been removed from the store so I've taken the link down since it's a 404 now.
