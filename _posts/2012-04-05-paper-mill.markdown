The developer of papermill, the first instapaper app for android has written an analysis of his first week on the android market.  
The app is priced ad 3.99â‚¬ and it requires an instapaper subscription to work.

It has been installed on 411 devices.  

> approximately $590 in profit thus far.

After a week, the launch week.

**Update (October 9, 2014):** Papermill has been removed from the store so I've taken the link down.
