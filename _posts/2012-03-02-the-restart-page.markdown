Have you ever wondered how is the restart animation of almost every system of the past (and of the present)?

You can find it on [the restart page][0].

It's really cool to look back to the early years at NeXt and find out that its restart process was pretty similar to windows nowadays.

And you can also compare how many seconds (or minutes) every OS takes to start.
