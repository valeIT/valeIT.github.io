After coming to Poland this summer I expected to see some snow by late Fall, but apart from the really cold temperatures compared to Italy the weather was nothing special, sun, rain and clouds, no snow at all.

Finally today we woke up with a really small cover of snow. Most of the roads are clean so it is not the kind of snow that you can go out with and have some fun throwing it to your friends/family, but it is still nice to see.

## Swiss Highways

The most snow we've seen was in the Italian/Swiss alps while coming back from Italy this november by car. There was so much snow that a lot of roads were closed and you could not go faster than 30 km/h on the highway in some areas. A lot of cars got stuck going uphill even though there were lots of snowplows in action.

## Previous Years

Last time I went to poland in winter there were 15 cm of snow, more than I've seen in Italy (apart from in the mountain region) in years. It has been hard to even move the car for a few km to go shopping. That year there were small piles of snow that turned into ice at the sides of the roads until march/april.
