I've written on how [I gave up][1] on using a pomodoro like software for eye fatigue since I could not find a good one. The idea of it was to take a break every so oftern not to strain your eyes too much.

It has now been a month since I went back and gave Time Out another try. I've installed it and have been using it for this whole tme. It is going much better now.

Every 20 minutes I'm asked to look away from the screen for 20 seconds.

I found it not too hurt my productivity, a good reminder to drink water during these 20 seconds and even though eye fatigue has not disappeared it seems that it is happening less often. It is still too little time to judge the results, but so far so good.

The only time when I get it is when I either ignore the break since I'm too focused working (I try not to do that more than once a day) or when I am on my screen for more than 10 consecutive hours (even including the breaks).
