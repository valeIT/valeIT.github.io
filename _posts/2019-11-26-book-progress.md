# Book Progress

A few week ago I announced that I'm working on my first ebook. I will be turning my Migrating From WordPress To Jekyll series into a short ebook. It will be released on the web for free and for a small fee in ebook format.

90% of the content will follow closely the series I've already written for the web. I "just" have to adapt it to be read one after another as a book and not in an episodic format. On top of that I need to heavily edit it since what I write on my blog is only slightly edited.

I have an active [pull request][1] that will stay open and document the progress in the writing/editing process.

There is not ETA for the moment, but I will keep everyone here updated on the progress every once in a while.
