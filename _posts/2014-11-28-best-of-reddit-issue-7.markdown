[Best of Reddit - Introduction:][0]

> There are so many great threads on reddit, every single day, but soon they disappear into the void - for the very nature of reddit itself. This is a place to save what I find most "useful" in a given week.
> 
> I'd bet that the quality of this panel is gonna vary a lot on a week by week basis, but I hope that overall it's gonna be worthwile --- you'll be the judge of that.

• [How compression works][1]

• [Askreddit thread about soldiers war story][2]

• [25 years of old dungeons and dragons maps][3]

• [Cinema and the use of CGI][4]

• [A guy finds out that he's colorblind][5]

• [Google map layer of LOTR filming locations][6]

• [Wait before saying that you have it on video, after having an accident][7]

• [Great conquerors playing risiko][8]

• [Popular sites report a fabricated reddit story][9]

• [Why gardens are illegal in New Zealand][10]

This is probably the best thread of the week, so hilarious how everyone seems perfectly legit while answering.

Bonus: I was about to publish when the news about Star Wars 7 broke out and since I'm a huge fan I can't refrain from commenting on it here. The [teaser][11] of episode 7 has been released, I can't deny that my reaction hasn't been positive at all. It seems like something for toddlers. If the whole movie is like this it's going to be a no go for me, sadly. I still hope they wanted to make fun of us with it... On the other hand everybody else on reddit seems to think that the trailer is great.
