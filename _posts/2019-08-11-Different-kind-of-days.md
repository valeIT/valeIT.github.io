There are days when you can't get anything done, no matter how long you spend at your desk trying to do something productive. On those days it is better to just stop and do something else for a while, a walk usually helps for me. Once you get back you can try again and usually you will be in a better place to start.

There are days when you want to do so much stuff, but there are not enough hours in the day to do everything so you have to either cut in scope (do less) or cut in quality (do more quickly) or cut your sleep (not recommended for your health).

Today is one of those days, I'm updating a few clients applications for iOS 13 and the process of doing through them sparkles your creativity. You come up with a lot of ideas that you want to implement, but you know you won't have time since you are already busy with this, that and that. So for now they're written all down and I will get to them in due time. For today I'm happy that I managed to update an app to the new OS in relatively little time considering.
