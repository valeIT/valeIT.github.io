Today I went to my local supermarket with my grandmother and I bought an apple, yes a simple green fresh apple.  
On the way back home I pulled off my headphones and I start eating it. I tried to focus only on the action of enjoying the fresh juice. I never eaten an Apple so focused and _believe me or not_ it has improved its taste.  
It was the very first time in a few years I really enjoyed eating an apple on the go, it's a compelling experience - if eating a simple apple can be called an 'experience'.

Try to choose a simple thing to do now and lose yourself in it, you'll feel better doing it and more refreshed after.

Trust me, Just try. And then [let me know][0].
