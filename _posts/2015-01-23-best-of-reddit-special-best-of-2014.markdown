[Best of Reddit - Introduction:][0]

> There are so many great threads on reddit, every single day, but soon they disappear into the void - for the very nature of reddit itself. This is a place to save what I find most "useful" in a given week.
> 
> I'd bet that the quality of this panel is gonna vary a lot on a week by week basis, but I hope that overall it's gonna be worthwile --- you'll be the judge of that.

[Not from TIL[^1]]

After a month hiatus from this column I couldn't leave you hanging with no Extras. Know that another extra is sheduled for next week, if all is good...

### Best posts from the previous year, as always not ordered.

• [A nice real life explanation on how hearing something --- even only a television can be of vital importance for an elder.][2]

• The title will suffice: [TIFU By having gay sex with my cousin when i was 6 years old and attempted to casually bring it up now that we are adults.][3]

Nope that's not all, it was with their wifes and a gay waiter too. All in.

• [To pass the time...][4]

• [Similar to the previous one][5]

• [Again similar, but GIFs this time][6]

• [Psycology tricks to do on people][7]

• [The best tale from a tech support guy ever][8]

[part 2][9]  
[part 3][10]  
[part 4][11]

This is so hilarious.

• [Free, useful things to get on the internet][12]

• [TIFU on chatroulette][13]

• [A guy deleted the whole mailing list for his company and reddit fixed the problem][14]

He got way more users than what he lost.

• [TIFU by following the no fraternizing at work rule][15]

• [Nobel of peace summit][16]

• [TIFU by smiling][17]

• [Tech support gets crazy at times --- Ops, all the times][18]

• [Leaks of secret documents][19]

• [God and Lucifer playing Chess.][20]

I'm sure that I've missed a bunch of them but that's it for 2014. See you next week for another Issue of "Best of Reddit". [^2]

[^1]: I decided not to include anything from Today I Learned subreddit since it's just a link to an outside source, unless the comments in itself can summarize the topic in its integrity. I also decided not to include "The Fappening", not only because it has been removed from Reddit a short time after the fact, but also because I'm not keen on invading the privacy of other people. Such high morals... XD
[^2]: Hope I won't have to change the name to "Worst of Reddit", but it doesn't seem the case. Reddit is still up there producing amazing hilariously content, and also more serious one --- from time to time.
