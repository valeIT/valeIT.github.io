On paper, I'm a big believer in going to bed early and waking up early. Truth be told, I always do the opposite. It's easier and I'm lazy.[^1]

I find myself writing more if I wake up early and just go for it without a real direction in mind, the problem is that I'm more of a night owl - I prefer working late into the night. The solution, at least for writing, is as I've written before to find your idea the day before. I usually do it in the evenings.

The important thing is getting your 8 hours of sleep per night. It doesn't really matter if you go to sleep early and wake up ealier or if you go to sleep late and wake up later. Just don't go to bed late and get up early. If you do it every once in a while for family or work emergencies is fine, but when it becomes the norm it is time to change something. If you're a freelancer say no to some jobs, if you're an employee give better time estimates (you will never be able to give accurate estimates, but look it on the bright side, there will always be room to improve).
