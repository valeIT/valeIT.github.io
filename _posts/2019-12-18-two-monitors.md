# Two Monitors

I used to code with only my MacBook for 4 years. No external keyboard, no external monitor, no mouse. It was clearly not the best setup, but I could get work done. It was not ergonomic, my wrists would hurt after a while and my position was not great so it is certainly not something I can recommend to people, but if you need to, it can be done.

For the last 4 months I have been using on a daily basis an external monitor, an external keyboard[^1] and a mouse.

Between all of the changes having 2 monitors has been the greatest one to increase my productivity. When I'm using my mac on the go using only one monitor now I often find myself for things that I would usually have open on my external monitor and I have to stop and switch to a different space. With 2 monitors I can just glance.

## Monitor Setup

A few ideas for developers:

1. My usual setup:
   - Screen 1: Full screen IDE.
   - Screen 2: Simulator or browser tab (on left side of the screen), Terminal (top right), Finder (bottom right).

2. Code Review:
   - Screen 1: Fullscreen Github/Gitlab/Bitbucket tab with Pull Request.
   - Screen 2: tab with Commit lists or local copy open in Tower/SourceTree.

3. Merge setup:
  - Screen 1: VSCode fullscreen for merge conflict with embedded terminal for git commands.
  - Screen 2: Tower/SourceTree to see git history and branches.

3. Writing Setup:
  - Screen 1: Writing app in fullscreen.
  - Screen 2: Live preview of the website for article writing or Hemingway Editor / Grammarly each taking half the screen for editing.

## Results

I can't go back. At home I still don't have an external monitor and it is a pain each time I try to work. I can do it, but I'm slower and more annoyed at the setup.
