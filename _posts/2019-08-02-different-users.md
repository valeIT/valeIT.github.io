There is a big range of technical people and sooner or later, if you make software for a living, you will stumble upon most of them.

There is the geek that always finds bugs and lets you know with such detailed bug reports that you start wondering how much time he spent writing it (you will appreciate the clearness).
There is the fellow developer that encourages you or points out something technical (maybe a wrong assumption, but maybe a right one).
There is the casual user that is content with using your app, but barely interacts with you or doesn't even know that you exist.
There is the color blind user that finds all your visual accessibility problems.
There is the partially blind user that finds all your other accessibility problems.
There is the elder that has no idea what your software does or how to use it, but tries anyway (and finds the part where the UX is unclear).
There is the perfectionist that tries to find every little pixel that he feels it's out of place (and politely let you know about it).

But you love all of them (almost) equally.

It is good to have all of this kind of users.

Some will find a certain type of problems, others will find others and in the end, your application will be better for it. Make sure to thank them and make them feel appreciated for their help and support and release a fix that addresses their concerns (if reasonable) in a timely manner. Also, make sure to let them know you're a one-man-shop, they will be more lenient with timings.

Of course, most of these users will never come in contact with you so you need to find a way to come in contact with them. It can be using anonymized analytics (but I didn't find it super useful for this specific area) or you can find those different users in your group of family and friends (does not scale).
