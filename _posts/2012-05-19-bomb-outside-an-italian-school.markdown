As italian I feel very sad and angry to hear this news, it's a shame.

> 6 students injured, 2 seriously, after pair of blasts outside a school in Brindisi, southern Italy - @[SkyNewsBreak][0]

#### This need to end

As i state in a [tweet][1] it's a shame that in 2012 Mafia can still do whatever they want. The government should put on top (with the economic plan) a plan against mafia, cosa nostra and all criminals organisations - especially when they bomb childrens for no reason at all.[1][2]

Violence is never the answer.

1. There's never a reason to bomb children's anyway.[↩][3]
