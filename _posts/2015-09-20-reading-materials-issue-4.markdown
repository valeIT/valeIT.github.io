[A nice insight on who buys iPods nowadays][5]

Cause everything is not always as you think it is.

> The average tech nerd will look at the $149 price of the Nano and compare it to the $199 Touch and wonder why someone wouldn't spend the extra $50 to get "so much more." This question simply displays a lack of understanding as to how the market at large currently works. It's similar to someone saying "why would you buy an iPad when you can buy a Windows laptop of the same price that does more?" You can't always say what's best for people to buy based on the raw tech specs.
> 

I might be just anothet tech guy trying to prove his point, but I don't agree. It's just a waste of money to buy the iPod nano and the iPad in those cases, no matter what's your use case. And I'm not talking about specs, I'm just talking about the difference in what you can do with the device. Even if the specs of the iPad/nano would be superior, buying a device that's way more capable and has way more feature is a better deal.

> This makes total sense when you consider that 10 year olds simply don't have MP3 collections anymore. They certainly don't have collections like we used to have when I was a kid. I used to buy CDs and rip them to my iPod. I would borrow CDs from friends to do the same thing. I would find many ways to get music and cram my iTunes full of as much music as possible. This is not what "the kids" do anymore, so an iPod that you need to load files onto is completely useless to them.

About this last one -\> [Wiki][40]:

> The latest time that can be represented in Unix's signed 32-bit integer time format is 03:14:07 UTC on Tuesday, 19 January 2038 (2,147,483,647 seconds after 1 January 1970).\[2\] Times beyond that will "wrap around" and be stored internally as a negative number, which these systems will interpret as having occurred on 13 December 1901 rather than 19 January 2038\. This is caused by integer overflow.
> 

Possible solutions:

> There is no universal solution for the Year 2038\. Any change to the definition of the time\_t data type would result in code compatibility problems in any application in which date and time representations are dependent on the nature of the signed 32-bit time\_t integer. For example, changing time\_t to an unsigned 32-bit integer, which would extend the range to the year 2106, would adversely affect programs that store, retrieve, or manipulate dates prior to 1970, as such dates are represented by negative numbers. Increasing the size of the time\_t type to 64-bit in an existing system would cause incompatible changes to the layout of structures and the binary interface of functions.
> 
> There is also no universal solution for the issue with DVB and ATSC real time transmitted dates due to issues with legacy receivers. Also the issue has yet to be acknowledged or resolved by either organization. The only work around would be to discontinue all time related metadata services such as programming guides and automatic date synchronization after the affected dates. One possible option would be to create new table types for the affected part of the specifications and use ISO 8601 date strings rather than fixed integers as is used in ISO 9660 and ISO 13346 filesystems.
> 
> Most operating systems designed to run on 64-bit hardware already use signed 64-bit time\_t integers. Using a signed 64-bit value introduces a new wraparound date that is over twenty times greater than the estimated age of the universe: approximately 292 billion years from now, at 15:30:08 on Sunday, 4 December 292,277,026,596\. The ability to make computations on dates is limited by the fact that tm\_year uses a signed 32 bit int value starting at 1900 for the year. This limits the year to a maximum of 2,147,485,547 (2,147,483,647 + 1900).\[12\]

Explanation for this last point:

> There was a fascinating bug in older versions of KVM on CentOS. Specifically, a KVM virtual machine had no awareness that it was not running on physical hardware. This meant that if the host OS put the VM into a suspended state, the virtualized system clock would retain the time that it had had when it was suspended. E.g. if the VM was suspended at 13:00 and then brought back to an active state two hours later (at 15:00), the system clock on the VM would still reflect a local time of 13:00\. The result was that every time a KVM VM went idle, the host OS would put it into a suspended state and the VM's system clock would start to drift away from reality, sometimes by a large margin depending on how long the VM had remained idle.
> 
> There was a cron job that could be installed to keep the virtualized system clock in line with the host OS's hardware clock. But it was easy to forget to do this on new VMs and failure to do so led to much hilarity. The bug has been fixed in more recent versions.

We used makefiles too, where the programmer would create a new .s file, and place it after everything else in the makefile.

One day I joked that the developer should replace the hex dump screen with a screen that says "Congratulations! You have discovered a secret code! Turn your console off and back on, then enter the username HALUCI." So he did. And that's how it shipped.

> We coded the game in straight Z80 assembly. There was lots of fun stuff like copying code to a white board and stepping through it one line at a time mentally, updating the memory contents on another white board, because we didn't have a real debugger. Good times.
> 
> Finally, around 5 am, after smashing our heads against this all night, we had an idea---not something we thought would work, but at least something worth trying. Mike coded the scoring system in Quick BASIC, and it scored just like the arcade machine. So we translated the BASIC, line by line to Z80 assembly.

> I then remembered that when you put the window in the notification area or in the start-menu bar, Windows immediately reclaims unused/freed memory. Here was our chance! I wound up adding a timer in the application that every couple of minutes would put the window in the Start menu bar, and display it fullscreen right after. It looked like a blink on screen, but it worked! We were able to ship after that, giving us some more time to fix the bug (which we found a few days later--- some window handle was not properly cleaned).

> Back in the 1970s I was working on a banking system with a team using a long-gone programming language known as MPL2\. This language had a restriction of 256 global variables and, since all were in use, adding new features to the system often meant searching for a variable to free up or use for two different purposes in different parts of the code. 
> 
> It was a risky and a time-consuming process. Within the program each function could have its own 256 variables limited to the scope of that function. At home one night a revelation came into my mind. The next morning I proposed to my boss that we wrap the entire code in a function. We would then have 256 global variables of the program available to us, as the current 256 were now safe in the "inner" function.
> 
> The program itself would just declare some more variables then call the function, which was the entire original program, but now able to "see" not only its own embedded 256 variables but also the newly available 256 global variables. My boss was skeptical but allowed me the two hour compile window to try it, and was dumbfounded when it worked, overcoming what had been a problem for the team for a couple of years.

[LLVM][84]

> LLVM's intermediate representation (IR) is its great innovation. LLVM works on a representation of programs that you can actually read if you can read assembly.
> 
> LLVM is nicely written: its architecture is way more modular than other compilers. Part of the reason for this niceness comes from its original implementor, who is one of us.
> 
> LLVM is also an industrial-strength compiler backed by the largest company on Earth. This means you don't have to compromise between a great compiler and a hackable compiler \[...\]
> 

**Pieces of LLVM**

> The front end, which takes your source code and turns it into an intermediate representation or IR. This translation simplifies the job of the rest of the compiler, which doesn't want to deal with the full complexity of C++ source code
> 
> The passes, which transform IR to IR. In ordinary circumstances, passes usually optimize the code: that is, they produce an IR program as output that does the same thing as the IR they took as input, except that it's faster. This is where you want to hack.
> 
> The back end, which generates actual machine code. You almost certainly don't need to touch this part.
>

This is necessary since the version in XcodeTools in not complete enough.

[API Docs][86]:

> You will need to live inside these API docs to make any progress at all while hacking on LLVM. Those pages can be hard to navigate, though, so I recommend going through Google. If you append "LLVM" to any function or class name, Google usually finds the right Doxygen page. (If you're diligent, you can even train Google to give you LLVM results first even without typing "LLVM"!)
