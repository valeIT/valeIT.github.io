After watching most videos from 2019 WWDC I went back to the previous years' keynote and tried to make the same list of "best videos" to watch.

# WWDC 2018

- [Keynote][0]
- [State of the Union][1]

These first three are a must every year. Some year the keynote is on a lower tone than another, but overall that's what we came for. Same thing for the state of the union.

- [Apple Design Award][2]

The Design Award is not a must, but it is interesting to watch just to take a note at what Apple considers to be the apps that are there to set a trend for the year or that they're using some new SDK features in a neat way.

- [What's New in Swift][3]
- [What's New in Cocoa Touch][4]
- [What's New in WatchOS][6]

As for above, these 3 are good to at least skim through to see the most important changes in the frameworks that we use on a daily basis. You might add other sessions on other Apple frameworks you use a lot, like for example Core Data,...

- [Introducing CreateML][5]
- [Engineering Subscriptions][7]
- [Strategies for Securing Web Content][8]

- [Introducing Dark Mode][9]
  This is obviously just for macOS since dark mode for iOS only came in 2019 with iOS 13.

_Let me [know][10] if I missed some great sessions (I probably did)._
