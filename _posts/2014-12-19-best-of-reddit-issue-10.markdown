[Best of Reddit - Introduction:][0]

> There are so many great threads on reddit, every single day, but soon they disappear into the void - for the very nature of reddit itself. This is a place to save what I find most "useful" in a given week.
> 
> I'd bet that the quality of this panel is gonna vary a lot on a week by week basis, but I hope that overall it's gonna be worthwile --- you'll be the judge of that.

Disclaimer: This column will be on hiatus for Christmas holidays (from today until January 6), but expect something special for the new year!

• [Writing Prompt - You live in a village in the dessert][1]

• [Most valuable items found in trash][2]

• I[nventions to eradicate][3]

I'd pick the atomic bomb at once, but now that they let me think about if landmines are terrible, still I think that everything related to atomic energy are a cancer for Earth itself, not only for humans.

• [Actor wars][4]

One of the most fascinating questions of the month for sure. I love Christopher Lee.

• [Live coverage of an hostage situation in Sydney][5]

• [The most dangerous thing you did as kid without realizing it until much older][6]

• [Teachers, who's the student that you'll never forget?][7]
