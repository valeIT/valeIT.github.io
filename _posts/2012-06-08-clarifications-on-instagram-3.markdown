Some have argued on my recent statement about Instagram for Android.  
Yes, i still consider the fact of the android app a big mistake, of course it's good for the guys at instagram - it has helped them a lot to get bought by Facebook, but that doesn't mean that is positive for the end users.

Instagram for iPhone had set a specific _(pretty high)_ minimum standard of quality, even the crappiest photo was shot by an iPhone 2g.  
Android phones on the other hand can be everything, from the chineese crappy 50$ tablet (with a 0.2 Megapixels front facing camera) to a Samsung galxy nexus, which [sucks anyway][1].
