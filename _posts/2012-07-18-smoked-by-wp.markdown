Microsoft claims a [98% success rate][0] for the campain "Smoked by Windows Phone".

It might be true, but i wonder if what [happened to Sahas Katta][1] would also happened to others.

Maybe it was the only case and i'm only too much suspicious, also because Microsoft admitted their mistake in a short period of time.

_But you never know, better suspitious than fool._
