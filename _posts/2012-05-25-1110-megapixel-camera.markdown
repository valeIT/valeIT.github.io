[This camera can take a picture of the sun and the stars at the same time.][0]

Until now these kind of cameras were only used for space instruments or on the ISS, but this camera is made for everyone.

Wonder who is the maker?  
Nope, it's not Nikon; Canon neither. It's Spectral Instrument, an almost unknown company.

There are also few throwbacks:  
It only takes black and white pictures and the exposure time can be of a few hours.

But it's a really good machine.
