Instagram has just [announced][0] that they have agreed to be bought by facebook for a billion $.

That's good for them, a bit less for the users.

First reaction: [noooooo][1].

Although I do hope that facebook will keep their word and keep developing Istagram indipendently, i'm really afraid it would end up as it happened with gowalla few years ago - they disappeared.

I still hope for the best, but most of the blogosphere is sleptical: Ben Brooks has already [deleted][2] his account.

# Few Stats

[dcurtis][3]:

> Instagram has generated $1,814,882 in value every day since its launch 551 days ago.  
> That's $1,260 per minute.

> Remember this day. 551-day-old Instagram is worth $1 billion. 116-year-old New York Times Co.: $967 million.
