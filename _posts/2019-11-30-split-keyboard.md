# Why a Split Keyboard?

I've been reading a lot about [carpal tunnel syndrome][1] in the last few days and I'm trying to be mentally aware of the position of my hands while typing. it seems that on a normal keyboard you cannot keep it aligned since the keys are too close to one another and either the right or the left wrist will have to tilt to reach certain letters. The solution would be to try a split keyboard or a keyboard that has some space between the right and left side of the keyboard. I know one person in the office is already using it and from what he tells me he can now type faster than on a normal keyboard.

Having the keyboard split and aligned to the resting position of your wrists means that you do not have to twist your wrist much at all.
