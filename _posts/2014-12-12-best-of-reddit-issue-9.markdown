[Best of Reddit - Introduction:][0]

> There are so many great threads on reddit, every single day, but soon they disappear into the void - for the very nature of reddit itself. This is a place to save what I find most "useful" in a given week.
> 
> I'd bet that the quality of this panel is gonna vary a lot on a week by week basis, but I hope that overall it's gonna be worthwile --- you'll be the judge of that.

• [Repairability of the international space station][1]

\[And once more I break the rule of not posting TIL threads here, but what can you do? Something just cannot remain unspoken of.\]  
Makes you realize how much it has been built with the ease of Repairability and redundancy in mind (especially the latter).

• [Most overrated foods served in restaurants][2]

Best post of the thread is probably an in depth [explanation][3] on why caviar is so expensive, and rightfully so (according to whoever posted the comment).

• [If you can speak, you can breath debuked][4]

And insights on lungs capacity and air intake/outtake.

• [Has anyone tried to intentionally kill you?][5]

An abuser is a redditor and gets a personal [appeal][6]:

> Yeah. Fuck you, unnamed Redditor. Reveal thyself so that I may unleash the fury of my downvote upon thee!

• [How is growing up as a child of a porn star][7]

Never thought about that until today.

• [Deep comment on the topic 'no sex until marriage'][8]

That's what it should mean. Nothing less and nothing more.

• [Redditor finds an old trunk from WWII][9]

Drinking alcohol can lead to something great, at times... (Disclaimer: I'm not encouraging the use of alcohol in any way you sneaky lawyers :P)

• [Slavery-free companies for this holiday season][10]

Where you should buy your Christmas gifts (if you're into that of course), nowhere else.

• [Great quotes][11]

A collection of thousands upon thousand great quotes all across history (from Ancient Greece to nowadays).

• [Good cops vs bad cops][12]

It's terrible to hear how dangerous it is to denounce a colleague.
