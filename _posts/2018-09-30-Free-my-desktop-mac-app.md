Lately I've been doing some screen recordings and screenshots for some projects and I had the necessity of making a quick tool to hide everything from the desktop to make it look neat.

## Free My Desktop

The screenshot above was created with Free My Desktop.

It automatically hides all the icons from your desktop, the dock and the menubar.

The app lives in the menubar itself so you can toggle 'focus mode' on and off as you please with a simple click.

The app is completely free, but I'd glad if you would [consider donating towards a cup of freshly roasted italian coffee][1].

<br><br>If you have tips or suggestions you can also find me on [Twitter][3].

Note: Unfortunately, due to Apple Sandboxing the app is not and will never be available through the Mac App Store.
