I found a few interesting university courses about game development and game design. As I've written in my goals <!-- [my goals][1] -->I want to get better at game development. I've made a few very basic games, but no more than that. The goal is not necessarely to release something to the public,but to get better and improve. If something comes out it's great, otherwise it's ok too. It's all about the journey.

Some links are more in the Development side of things than design, others the opposite, but they do often overlap. I've tried to separate them into the two different categories, but it is not a strict divider.
