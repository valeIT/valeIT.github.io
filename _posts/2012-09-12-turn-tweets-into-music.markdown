[The Listening Machine][0]  
by Daniel Jones and Peter Gregson:

> The Listening Machine is an automated system that generates a continuous piece of music based on the activity of 500 Twitter users around the United Kingdom. Their conversations, thoughts and feelings are translated into musical patterns in real time, which you can tune in to at any point through any web-connected device.

Below the player itself there are also many graphs showing datas about those tweet.

Useful? Maybe not, but it's cool to see people come up with weird/different ideas.

That's the future in development.

As Bertrand Russell said:

> Do not fear to be eccentric in opinion, for every opinion now accepted was once eccentric.
