Last weekend we went on a trip to the countryside and we stumbled upon a village fair. They only have it once a year and they look back at the previous year (how the crops went, how many people left and came and so on). I found it to be really interesting. If you live there it is the day to go out and be with your neighbours while listening to facts that interests everybody. There are of course way better ways to do this, but it is fun and a great tradition.

They had a lot of guests (mainly farmers) that explained their crops and how the year went for them. The bitter note about it is that most of the talks (like 90%) were about how climate change this year affected their businesses big time. Really high temperature (for this area they're unseen and nobody is prepared for it) and draughts caused more than 100m EUR in damages in this this small city alone.
