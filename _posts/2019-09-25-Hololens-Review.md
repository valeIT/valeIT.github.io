I've been using the Microsoft Hololens for over 6 months. 4 of those in production in physical stores for an international brand. I've used them in events with weird artificial lightning, in normal sunny days, with people and without anyone around. The only test I did not do was outside, I've always used them indoors.

## Technological Wow Factor

I call it the "wow factor". The first time you put it on. Even if you've seen how they work during one of the multiple keynotes or presentations, got told by a colleague, or know what they are and their capabilities on paper nothing can compare to actually experiencing it by yourself. Being able to see an holographic object placed right in front of you, like you can see anything else in the real world is astounding. The real difference is that you see it there since the lenses are transparent and not through a camera like AR[^3] on phones or a screen that you cannot see through like VR. I cannot stress enough how important it is that they let you see the real world without recreating it.

The unique feature is having an open field of view. You're not behind a screen. They're open, just like traditional glasses. If you shut the whole system off (without taking the glasses off from your face) you see the real world behind the transparent lenses and not a black screen.

<!-- Part 1 -->

I've tried the various "alternatives" (mainly Facebook Oculus and the HTC Vive), but I'm of the idea that they're different products. Products for a different audience and a different market. The closed headsets (Oculus and the Vive) are more directed to gamers offering an immersive experience, while the Hololens are more directed to businesses being able to merge the real world with holograms. You shouldn't make the error to think that all competing for the very same market. They are not. There are obviously many areas of overlap between them, but they do not overlap completely.

I might be exaggerating things a bit to make a point, but the difference is there. It is obvious to anyone who's tried both and if you ever have the opportunity to do so, you should. You might not like it at first, but it is worth just to have the experience and know what the current limit of technology is.

It's not set in stone. Microsoft could move towards the gaming crowd and Facebook / HTC towards the business crowd. This is the situation at this moment, but it doesn't seem like it's changing so far.

One last thing is to take a note at the huge price difference. It is steep. Obviously Hololens is still on a technical preview (even the price went down a little already) so the price should go down with tine, but they are at least an order of magnitude more expensive.

## Technological limitations

Indoor positioning is hard, more so in a changing environment.

We had to use them during events with thousands of moving people and varying lighting.

They performed poorly. They're not the device for that specific job.

They're great if they can map the ambient around them beforehand and if the room is static[^2]. If so, you can shut them off, move them to a different position in the room and turn them back on without fear. When you do, they figure out where they are in an instant and place the hologram where you left it, with the exact rotation that you left it on.

## On Commercial Edition

If you're showing it to clients, do yourself a favor and get the Commercial Edition. Nothing is worse than the app closing during a demo because of a gesture made at random. Even though it looks similar to the bloom gesture[^1] is not something you can do without knowing it happens (I speak from experience).

The price difference is steep, but worth.

Consider that you can't upgrade a development license to a Commercial one. And do it before buying your first device - if you're a small company and getting a single Hololens is a significant investment.

## Competition

The difference between Hololens and Vive/Oculous is not really well understood. They are completely different products for completely different use cases. Having a blocked field of view against having an open one is a huge difference, as much as I don't consider them to be comparable.

## Conclusion

It's a niche device with huge innovative potential, but in its current state is still an unrefined product, more adept at demos about the technology that actual use in a production environment.

That said I'm pretty sure that AR[^3] and VR[ˆ3] are the next big thing in tech.

[^1] : (the one that closes the app and brings you back to the desktop)
[^2]: Doesn't change with time. This includes both the lighting, the objects and the people in the space.
[^3]: AR stands for Augmented Reality. Usually referred at a visual representation of the real world "augmented" by technology. VR stands for Virtual Reality. In this case the real world is not simply augmented, but simulated "ex-novo".
