Finally Apple listened to [Michael Dell][0]: they're giving the money back to the share holders, exactly 2,65$ a share.

Tim cook announced in a conference call yesterday that Apple will [initiate][1] a dividend and a share repurchasing program using 10 of their 100 billions to do so in the next 3 years.

But they didn't talk only about this, Tim Cook, asking to an inappropriate question said:

> We love to announce new products, we just don't do it in conference calls
> 

Of course he's right!

Update: and their cash will still grow according to the latest predictions.
