# Lesson learned after one year and half of freelancing

<!-- After being a freelancer for more than one year I went back into  being almost like an employee. I'm still technically a freelancer, but I've dropped most of my clients to sign a contract with one client for which I'm working your typical 40 hours a week. -->

The hardest thing to do as a freelancer is to find a constant stream of work. Constant being the key word of the sentence. You always hear about that one month when this freelancer made so much money, but you rarely year about all the months in between when they billed for zero. It all balances out in the end, but it is a constant struggle.

I knew it was going to be hard. Knew it from the start. I heard the stories. And I already started prepared. Or so I initially thought.

# Start Prepared

When I jumped ship into freelancing (leaving on good terms with the previous company I worked for) I already had several good clients lined up (including that very company). The problem was that not all of them were good companies to freelance for. You see, how a company treats their employees or other companies employees is completely different from how they treat external contractors. Be wary of that.

Even if you know how it works as an insider do not assume that's how they treat external people too. For some companies it might be the case and I was lucky to find a few that do, but for many others it is not a given.

# Incosistent Work

Another problem is simply the amount of work not being consistent. The previous company I worked for helped get the ball rolling in the start, but they could only offer so much work. There were other months on the other ends where I had to turn down work simply because I wouldn't have the time to complete it.

# Time 'wasted'

A lot of time is 'wasted' trying to get clients, waiting proposals, having meetings, administration and the like. All time you can't really bill for. It might be that one month you turn away work because too much comes at you and another month where you can't sign a single contract.
