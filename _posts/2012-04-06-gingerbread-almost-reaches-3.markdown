After almost 6 months Gingerbread has [reached][0] the all time high of 3% of userbase! Impressive!

iOs 5.1 has reached 12% two days after the release and two weeks after the release was already at 60%.

As i [said before][1]:

And times keep going on without any news from google on the matter.

It seems like they don't care at all.
