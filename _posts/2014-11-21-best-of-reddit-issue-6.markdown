[Best of Reddit - Introduction:][0]

> There are so many great threads on reddit, every single day, but soon they disappear into the void - for the very nature of reddit itself. This is a place to save what I find most "useful" in a given week.
> 
> I'd bet that the quality of this panel is gonna vary a lot on a week by week basis, but I hope that overall it's gonna be worthwile --- you'll be the judge of that.

• What if the D-Day never happened

Without the D-Day the world would be a completely different place with the soviets storming all over Europe and changing the balance of world power probably for a very long time.

• [Confusing Label][1]

How a wrong translation can drastically ruin everything. \[NSFW\]

• [Industrialization in Middle Earth][2]

The link is misleading, don't mind it.

• [What to do if you got control over squirrels][3]

For once a single comment, but it struck me out how that could really work even in today's world. But imagine what would happen if it happened a few hundreds years in the past, you would ended up as god.

• [What happens after a wow release in it's subreddit][4]

Aka: hell breaks lose.

• [User promises to answer all prompts on the thread or he would delete his account with 3 months of gold, he ends up deleting it.][5]

He didn't even last a day. So much lost potential.

• WritingPrompts - [An identity theif steals someone's identity only to realize their life sucks, and proceeds to better it][6]

• [Another view on taxes][7]

I never thought about it this way, but I guess he's right - still, fuck taxes.

• [Reddit admin asks the community how they should spend the venture funding they got][8]

It's great to see one company caring this much about it's users, it's a rare sight in tech lately.

• [The real horrors][9]

What a man can go through...

--

Bonus: [Philae landed successfully on a comet.][10] that's probably the greatest news for space exploration since the landing on the moon in 1969\. It's sad to see that nothing major happened between these 2 moments ( yes, I know that we launched Hubble, the international space stations and countless robots around - but nothing at this magnitude until now).
