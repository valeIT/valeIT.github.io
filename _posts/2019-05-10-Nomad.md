I've always been attracted to the digital nomad movement, even though I am not really a part of it myself. I've never tried going fully nomad even though I've worked remotely for a while. The most I did was living in Poland fr a year and spending 2 months in the United States.

I feel at odds because I would also like to own a house some day and reconciling the 2 things that are basically the opposite of each other leaves me in a conondrum.

Maybe the solution would be having a mobile house (camper) and go whenever you want with it. The problem is that you're going to be tied to one specific area, unless you want to drive tens of thousands of miles which is not feasible.

There is a middle ground between going fully nomad and being in one place though. You can still own a house and mostly live there, but take a few months out of the year to go somewhere else. Sure, the purists of digital nomadism might laugh and say that's not what a true nomad would look like, but others judging you should never be something that discouradges you from doing what you want in life.
