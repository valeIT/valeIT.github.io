# Why am I writing 200 words a day?

_I had a problem. I used to write a lot, but I did not publish as often as I'd have liked._

Most people stress on quality over quantity. Write a few articles, but write stuff that matters. I used to be in that boat too. Recently I realized that line of thought is fallacious, at least for me.

If you don't put in the time and the quantity, you won't get to the quality you want. You are going to spend a lot of time just to publish something that meets your unreachable level of quality.

_Write. Edit as much as you can. Put it out there._

The last point is just as important as the other two (if not more). If your articles only stay on your hard drive what was the point of writing them at all?

If you want to have a private diary or want to write for your own reference that's totally fine, but don't start writing with the goal of publishing and then since it's not "good enough" you don't. Push through. You might get criticized for it, but you will learn and get better.

After 6 months go back to your first articles and look at how rubbish they look. You put in the work. That's how you improve.

_The only way to fail is not to run. Persistence is key._
