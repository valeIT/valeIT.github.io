When I was a teen I had a lot of free time after school, way more than I have now working a full time job.

Most kids my age used to go out and drink. I used to stay home and read. Yes, I was (and still am) the shy kid. I would also play computer games from time to time, but not as often as I would be reading.

In these last few months I'm trying to read whenever I can, before that I would only read one or two books a year. This year I've read 5 books so far and I'm on track to read at least one more by the end of the year. I could read way more if I forced myself to, but I don't want to force it too much.

Reading should be something that you do because you enjoy it, not something that you do to hit a target of "number of books to read in [insert a specific timeframe]".

You need to read with an open mind and will. Having a forced limit is counterproductive to that objective.

## What I've been reading in 2019

I'm mostly been reading Fantasy books for fiction and Business books for non fiction.

**Non Fiction:**

The non fiction section has been dominated by Basecamp.

- Getting Real by Basecamp
- Rework by Basecamp
- Remote by Basecamp
- Shape Up by Basecamp
- It doesn't have to be crazy at work by Basecamp

On top of the books I'm also listening to the [podcast][1], I especially recommend the episodes with the CEO of WordPress about the future of the web and of 1Password about their first founding round and what it means getting VC funding.


**Fiction:**

- Oathbringer by Brandon Sanderson
- Arcanum Unbounded by Brandon Sanderson
The fantasy author to look for. His books deliver consitently and he writes at an unmatched pace.
- Fire & Blood by George R R Martin
Fire & Blood is not Winds of Winter unfortunately. The book was pretty meh, but the backstory of Aegon and how he Targaryens rose to claim the 7 kingdoms was interesting regardless.

Next year I plan to keep reading more business/productivity related books and get up to par with the rest of Brandon Sanderson books. Pretty sure that will take the whole year so I will not add any other book for the times being.
