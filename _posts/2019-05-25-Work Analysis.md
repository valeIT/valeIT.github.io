# Work Analysis

I've been running [Observe][1] since I bought this Mac last August. During that time I've spent around 40 days doing productive tasks. This doesn't mean that I've been productive only for 14 days, but that the hours tracked on my Mac all summed up together round up to 40 days. Considering there are 241 days between September 26 (the day I started tracking the time I spend on Mac ) and today and that on average I spend 4 hours a day (including weekends) doing actual work (that is not emails or other fluff).

241 days _ 4 hours a day = 964 hours
40 days _ 24 hours tracked = 960 hours

My self assumed average was pretty on point!

241 days _ 4 hours a day = 964 hours
241 days _ 8 hours a day = 1928 hours

If I spent 8 hours a day, every day, I would have double the productive hours I had.

It is also interesting to take a look at the productive hours per month. I smashed it in September and October with 61% and 57% productive time respectively. In November and December, I only had 15% and 10% which seem utterly terrible even though I got more done than I thought I would have in such a short amount of time. And I went back over 50% for the remaining months.

\*This is not true though since a lot of time that was marked as neutral was actually productive time that was incorrectly categorized. Considering that time more than doubles the productive time so all is good.

Having [off days][2] is fine every once in a while, even though it's your passion you can't just work all the times. When they become as they did in November or December though ring bells should start to ring (unless you know something like \* that explains it).

Another interesting day to check is November 17, when I participated in the [24 hours startup challenge][3] with more than 12 hours of productive time tracked from 8am to after 2am.

# Most Used Applications

In the productive category, my most used application by far with 20% of time used is VSCode. I just love it, I use it for everything apart from 3 things:

- Native Mac and iOS Development for which I use Xcode
- Native Android Development for which I use Android Studio
- Game Development for which I use Unity

Everything else is from VSCode, even this article.

The second application is without any surprise Xcode with 5%.

The third is iTerm with 1%.

It is staggering to see the difference between the percentage of VSCode and everything else. It is not even close.
