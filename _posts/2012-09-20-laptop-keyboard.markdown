I spent the whole afternoon writing on a crappy windows laptop keybord.

Oh man how an awful experience!  
I continued tapping key i didn't meant to, i activated a few times the caps lock, the mail button, the browser button and the bluetooth button - no jokes! Then the windows app (Markdownpad) got also in the way moving my cursor around for no reason (apparently). And the typos.

_I was so happy with this app.._

Unfortunately fairytales must end.

There is not a single program on windows that is worth or doesn't have a fair or better counterpart on OS X. Apart from games of course, but that's another story.
