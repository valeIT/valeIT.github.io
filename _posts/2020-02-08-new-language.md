Trying to learn a new language is hard. Especially if it had nothing in common with any language you do speak.

I've been on and off trying to learn polish for the past few years with basically zero success. I know some basic words and phrases, but I wouldn't be able to hold my own even in basics conversations.

Duolingo simply does not work in this case.[^1] If I was learning Spanish or French I think Duolingo would be great. In this case it just teaches some vocabulary, but without knowing the rest you end up with a giant mess. That's why I decided to only use it every once in a while and instead try to learn by reading an actual course book.

I'm just starting out so I'm still not sure how this will go. Hopefully better than just using Duolingo.

[^1]: At least it simply does not work for me.
