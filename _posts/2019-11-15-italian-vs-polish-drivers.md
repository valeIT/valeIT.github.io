[I've written about polish drivers in a different article][1], this time I will write about Italian drivers instead.

- In Italy drivers are way less polite than in Poland.

In Poland if you make a mistake lining up or need some space to manouver most people will understand and help you, in Italy they just ignore you and sometimes even try as much as they can not to leave you any space to merge. That unless they're truck drivers, they're usually good everywhere.

- In Italy drivers don't know how to drive on highways

You notice that you've passed the border into Italy by counting the number of people staying in the left lane even though they're not passing anyone and the right lane is completely empty. I haven't seen any other European country where drivers drive like that so consistently.
