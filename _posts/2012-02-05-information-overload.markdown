Lately there has been a growing interest for minimalism and to try to better use our time online.  I've been introduced to the concept of minimalism by [Diego Petrucci][0], [Leo Babauta][1] and [Patrick Rhone][2], I strongly suggest to read their blogs.

The term is 'information overload'. (...) It is caused by our lacks of control over our digital information system (RSS,twitter,..) if we skip important activities on our everyday lie just to stay online we have to change something.  Usually these are small changes, like try to keep only relevant feeds (or use feever if you have your own server), or unfollow some people on twitter, but few times we want to stop and take a break, a break from the internet. This is exactly what Beppe Servegnini, an Italian journalist did a week ago. He completely disconnected from the internet and he tried to do his job using other tools, it has been very difficult, but he made it. I'm suggesting of doing something so radical,but a few smaller things (unfollow a few persons, unsubscribe from a feed) will help.
