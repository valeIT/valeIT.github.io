# Exhausting a topic

I always thought (and you might as well) that writing a blog post about a topic means you have to exhaust it. Write all you know to give the reader the most complete picture, but that's not all.

You definitely should be giving out as much information to the reader as possible. You also should not end the post with something final, the ending should feel open and welcoming.

# Leave it open ended

A call to action to either use the knowledge gained to do something or go somewhere else (maybe a link to another post on your blog) to learn even more about the topic.

Whenever you write a blog post, don't close the argument without leaving any option open to discuss it further. You always want to leave it a bit open ended. This way the conversation can continue and the reader can add their own thoughts to it and be drawn to the topic again. You might learned something new about it as well if they decide to later share their findings with you.
