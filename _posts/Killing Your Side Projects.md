Killing Your Side Projects

I like to test ideas and move on relatively quickly if I don't see that it is interesting enough. More time for the next one.

There are good and bad things about this kind of approach. There are a few Projects that I've been supporting for years, but they're fairly low maintenance. That usually means  just updating them to make sure they're compatible with the next OS version since I can't really justify spending much time on them considering the revenue is simply not there.  Most of them I just abandon quickly, sometimes even before sharing it with anyone if the idea doesn't seem interesting or if commercially unsuccesful which many have said it's the wrong approach.

The question when to pull the plug is a hard one. And you can never be 100% certain that the decision to do it or not to do it and try releasing one more feature was the right one. You can usually see the trajectory though. Either a product got enough traction to justify investing in it further, or it did not. That is not bulletproof since a product that didnt get traction might be for some reason that can be fixed.
