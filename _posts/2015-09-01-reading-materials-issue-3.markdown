[North Korea's 'internet'][35]

> Incredibly, amid what appears to be largely pointless color graphics and screenshots, is a list of 26 network locations, which based on what we know of North Korea's network is a large chunk of its entire internet.
> 
> Or, more accurately, intranet. Because all the IP addresses listed are in private address ranges, which are unreachable from the public internet. The intranet is called "Kwangmyong" which means literally "network." It opened in 2000, and apparently has up to 5,500 websites on it. So this map must list some of North Korea's top picks.
> 
> Of the 26 addresses shown, 21 are in the 10.x.x.x range, three are in the 172.x.x.x range and two are in the 192.x.x.x range, which most of us use for setting up home routers.
> 
> North Korea does appear to have introduced a domain name system to translate the IP addresses to actual words (eg, 10.2.3.4 to example.com) but based on photos of North Koreans actually using their intranet, it seems as though they continue to use the IP address over Korean words. That could imply that there is only a partial DNS in place, or that with so few IP addresses, it's just easier to use the numbers.
> 
> According to the table, most of the 26 lucky nodes are universities and government institutions like the "Central Information Agency for Science and Technology" or the "Kim Chaek University of Science and Technology."
> 
> Of course, it is possible (probable?) that North Korea's network has reserved an arbitrary range of IP addresses for its government and military, but you can bet they are not reachable from the public internet.
> 
> What is life like online in North Korea? According to reports, the intranet is free to use but somewhat limited. In all senses. You have to have permission to own a computer and you register it with the government. Only people specifically authorized by the government are allowed to get on the global internet, and they amount to a few thousand in a country of 25 million.
> 
> In case you're wondering, North Korea's official public IP address block is 175.45.176.0/22, and is run by its government telco Star. Some websites, such as the nation's news agency KCNA, are hosted from that range, and are reachable from the public internet.

[iOS breaking design rules][44]

I don't agree with all the points, but most of them make sense.

> Deviating from well-researched interface patterns is usually not recommended. It is better to follow the probable best practices, knowing that consistency and knowledge transferred from use of other iOS apps will prime users' expectations. With any guidelines or style guides, doing usability testing can demonstrate or disprove if the guideline works well in your own design. Through watching people use these designs, we have witnessed enough consistent issues to recommend against using these 4 patterns.

[Why is it so controversial when someone says "All Lives Matter" instead of "Black Lives Matter"?][71]

Make sure to read the first comment, the whole of it.

> TL;DR: The phrase "Black lives matter" carries an implicit "too" at the end; it's saying that black lives should also matter. Saying "all lives matter" is dismissing the very problems that the phrase is trying to draw attention to.

[iCloud Mess][75]

> Every Mac developer that uses iCloud has a dirty little secret:  
> They don't fully test their software before they ship it to customers on the Mac App Store. It's because Apple won't let them.  
> \[...\]  
> Mac developers have never had access to TestFlight, either internally or externally. It's "coming soon", and until that day comes, there's no way to test apps that use the iCloud servers. Which sucks for both the developer and the customer.  
> Apple is touting analytics as an awesome new feature for developers that use the App Store to distribute their creations. It's a huge benefit to our businesses, but only when you're selling solely on iOS. This feature is nowhere to be found on the Mac App Store. Again, it's "coming soon".  
> Just yesterday, Apple did something great for developers. They now block reviews on beta OS releases. Unless that operating system is for the Mac.  
> Let me guess: it's "coming soon".  
> Updated July 23rd, 2015: I think the thing that bothers me most about this situation is the inequality. Mac developers aren't getting the same value from the App Store as their counterparts on iOS. We all pay Apple 30% of our earnings to reach our customers, we should all get the same functionality for that fee.
> 

I had to quote the whole thing as a Mac developer myself. It feels like being second class at times.. When it really shouldn't be the case.

[Work Life Balance][80]

I always hate it when people identify themselves with their job. "I'm a programmer."

That's such a limited view on what a person is, and if it's not, if really all you are and identify in is your job than I don't see why we should be friends.

Don't miss understand, I love programming and the link, but I also love other things as well.

I've been using Sketch for a year too. Only one thing is extremely annoying: At times - randomly - the app will crash, right before you press save = hours and hours of work down the drain. Photoshop NEVER did that in 4+ years of use.
